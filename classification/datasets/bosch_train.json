{"sentence":{"0":"Who hacked the Democratic National Committee?","1":"**Who hacked the Democratic National Committee?**","2":"On June 14, the Washington Post published a [story](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/national-security\/russian-government-hackers-penetrated-dnc-stole-opposition-research-on-trump\/2016\/06\/14\/cf006cb4-316e-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0\\_story.html?hpid=hp\\_hp-banner-main\\_dnc-hackers-1145a-banner%3Ahomepage%2Fstory) that indicated Russian government hackers had hacked into the Democratic National Committee (DNC).","3":"The specific information linking the hack to the Russian government came from the cyber security company [CrowdStrike](https:\/\/www.crowdstrike.com\/):","4":"> One group, which CrowdStrike had dubbed Cozy Bear, had gained access last summer and was monitoring the DNC\u2019s email and chat communications, Alperovitch said.","5":"> The other, which the firm had named Fancy Bear, broke into the network in late April and targeted the opposition research files.","6":"I personally know a number of smart people who work at CrowdStrike and I trust them when they say that a specific intrusion or incident is linked to a specific hacking group.","7":"With regards to linking intrusion sets to groups, CrowdStrike uses an animal naming scheme to tie intrusion activity and intrusion sets to groups and countries.","8":"In this case CrowdStrike said that they observed intrusions in the DNC tied to the groups they call *Cozy Bear* and *Fancy Bear* where Bear signifies Russia.","9":"I have no doubts at all that CrowdStrike indeed observed intrusion set activity within the DNC\u2019s environment that linked to these groups they had identified and were almost certainly actively tracking.","10":"On June 15, an actor who calls himself *Guccifer 2.0* created a [Wordpress blog](https:\/\/guccifer2.wordpress.com) where he posted a number of claimed confidential reports from the DNC including one on Donald Trump.","11":"In the blog post, an effort appears to be made to say how easy it was to hack the DNC and called into question CrowdStrike who linked two intrusions of the DNC to the Russian government.","12":"For those that aren\u2019t aware, the handle [*Guccifer*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guccifer) was used by a Romanian hacker who was recently extradited to the United States.","13":"*Guccifer* currently sits in a jail in Virginia awaiting sentencing.","14":"**Russia.","15":"* Attribution of the observed intrusion sets (malware, exploits etc) to known intrusion groups.","16":"This is where CrowdStrike tied this activity to the groups they call *Cozy Bear* and *Fancy Bear.*","17":"* Attribution of the threat grouping to a specific person, group\/organization or nation state where in this case CrowdStrike has clearly singled out Russia.","18":"On the first point, I have complete confidence that CrowdStrike is able to track and link specific intrusions tools to known groups which they actively track.","19":"On the second point, it is a little more unclear whether this activity is tied to the Russian government and I can\u2019t really comment on that as I don\u2019t have information that supports this or not.","20":"Confidential and internal information within the DNC would be of clear interest to the Russian government and other governments.","21":"It might also be of interest to a politically motivated hacker who would want to discredit the DNC by publishing their sensitive information.","22":"A good example of this is where [iSIGHT Partners](https:\/\/isightpartners.com) was able to [tie](http:\/\/freebeacon.com\/national-security\/cyber-caliphate-hackers-not-linked-to-islamic-state\/) a claimed Islamic State (ISIL) hacking group to a Russian group they track as APT28.","23":"One thing for sure with *Guccifer 2.0* is that he clearly has demonstrated access to internal documents of the DNC.","24":"* One or both of the groups identified by CrowdStrike is tied to *Guccifer 2.0* and this is a disinformation campaign against CrowdStrike and the DNC.","25":"* *Guccifer 2.0* is a distinct threat actor who had access to the DNC\u2019s systems at some point.","26":"At no way does this mean CrowdStrike was wrong with linking the activity they saw in the DNC\u2019s environment.","27":"Based on the style and how it has been done, it looks like it was written by someone who doesn\u2019t speak English as a first language and uses mannerisms used by people based in Eastern Europe or was purposely written like this.","28":"I\u2019ll add that initially I was surprised by how quickly a disinformation operation could possibly have been executed after the Washington Post article.","29":"I\u2019ll finish things off by repeating that in my opinion the emergence of *Guccifer 2.0* does not at all conflict with CrowdStrike\u2019s findings.","30":"*Guccifer 2.0* may be a separate actor or may be tied to one or both of the intrusion groups CrowdStrike claims were active inside the DNC.","31":"By the Intel 471 Malware Intelligence team.","32":"The threat actor that sent this malspam campaign demonstrated good operational security (OPSEC) by hiding their infrastructure behind professional bulletproof hosting (BPH) services and by filtering traffic to hide final payloads from curious researchers.","33":"The actor used a series of tools in this operation, including KeitaroTDS, a malicious Microsoft Excel spreadsheet document builder and the Zloader banking trojan (aka Terdot).","34":"Considering the nature of the malspam documents (usually named \u201cInvoice\u201d) and the use of a banking trojan, we assess the intended goal of the attackers was to make unauthorized bank transfers from victim accounts.","35":"The sender was an AOL mail account, using the AOL mail portal and a Windows machine using the Google Chrome browser (if the user agent can be trusted).","36":"The document implemented malicious Excel 4.0 Macros (XLM) to download and execute the secondary stage payload.","37":"These macros were present in a hidden sheet named \"DiOAFArhpr\".","38":"The macros were written vertically, character-by-character inside

businesses worldwide.","100":"The threat actors responsible for developing and maintaining the malware have released an updated ransomware, namely version 2.2.","101":"### Persistence mechanism","102":"REvil ransomware persists on a machine if the **arn** configuration field is set to **true**.","103":"It writes its path to the registry key **SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run**.","104":"An example of the value name of the registry key entry is **mjOObKp0yy**.","105":"In version 2.1, first collected by our systems March 15, 2020, this persistence mechanism was removed.","106":"It seems this little experiment didn\u2019t go as planned, because the new version 2.2 brings the same persistence mechanism back.","107":"### Restart Manager to terminate processes","108":"One of the more interesting new features of REvil version 2.2 is the use of the Windows Restart Manager to terminate processes and services that can lock files targeted for encryption.","109":"If a process has an open file handle for a specific file, then writes to that file by another process (in this case, a ransomware) it will be prevented by the Windows operating system (OS).","110":"To circumvent this, the REvil developers have implemented a technique using the Windows Restart Manager also used by other ransomware such as SamSam and LockerGoga (see: ).","111":"REvil ransomware opens files for encryption with no sharing (dwShareMode equals 0).","112":"The following explains how REvil employs this technique:","113":"* If a normal process is using the file, it is terminated by a call to **TerminateProcess**.","114":"* If a service is encountered, **ControlService** is invoked with the **SERVICE\\\\_CONTROL\\\\_STOP** control code to stop the service followed by a call to **DeleteService**.","115":"* If a critical process is encountered, its critical status is removed by calling **ZwSetInformationProcess** with the information class **ProcessBreakOnTermination** before terminating it.","116":"A new command-line option -silent was added that skips termination of blacklisted processes, services and shadow copy deletion.","117":"Iran\u2019s domestic espionage: Lessons from recent data leaks","118":"In the last decade, Iran has undergone a quiet revolution.","119":"Since the\u201cGreen Movement\u201d uprising in 2009, more Iranians have dared to openly oppose their regime.","120":"The reasons include accusations of elections tampering, global sanctions, increased inflation, heavy investment of state funds in the nuclear and arming programs, and ambitious regional policies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and others, amid a deteriorating socioeconomic situation of the average Iranian.","121":"There was a lot of talk in the past about Iran\u2019s espionage measures and offensive cyber activities targeting other countries.","122":"However, growing domestic unrest prompted the Iranian regime to invest more resources in developing espionage capabilities aimed against its own citizens.","123":"During the past year, a number of online activists have leaked what they claim to be inside information about the regime\u2019s surveillance methods, in an attempt to expose the unethical tactics used by Iranian security forces.","124":"Among the top whistleblowers are operators of the Lab Dookhtegan (translated in Persian as \u201cstitched lips\u201d) Telegram channel and an activist named Masoud Molavi.","125":"Molavi, assassinated by Iranian agents in November 2019, was a former cybersecurity official behind the Black Box Telegram channel that was responsible for many notable leaks of Iranian government information.","126":"The series of leaks uncovered hundreds of documents that offer a glimpse into the way Iran is spying on its own people.","127":"According to the leaked information, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence Services (MOIS) developed numerous tools, malicious software, surveillance systems and data analysis platforms, in order to control citizens in Iran and abroad.","128":"Much of this activity allegedly was conducted in the Rana Intelligent Computing Institute, an organization working under the Iranian MOIS, involved in internal espionage by developing unique tools and gaining access to a variety of foreign countries\u2019 infrastructure.","129":"According to the information shared by these whistleblowers, Iran is heavily investing in the development of customized tools and malicious software for domestic espionage.","130":"For example, the Iranian regime developed a surveillance system dubbed Abi, which allegedly was used to spy on political activists, human rights lawyers, regime opponents and protesters by intercepting Bluetooth communications.","131":"According to an Iranian blog called Arezooyenatamam, (translated in Persian as \u2018an unfinished dream\u201d), this system has been installed on pickup trucks posted in strategic locations in Iran such as university campuses or protest centers.","132":"A screenshot from the Abi system monitoring of Sharif UniversityThe Iranian regime also developed customized malware used for stealing information from citizens.","133":"One example found in those leaks was called WinspySuite, a remote access and information stealing malware that reportedly was used specifically to spy on suspects arrested by the regime.","134":"Internally referred to as Peyvand, the malware allegedly was loaded onto a target\u2019s computer via a USB flash drive during interrogations or sent via a malicious link to a victim\u2019s email address.","135":"The regime also developed a remote access tool for Android and iPhone mobile devices as part of a project dubbed Project 220.","136":"The malware purportedly was able to steal sensitive data from a victim\u2019s device, including call data, text messages, contacts and locations.","137":"A screenshot from the Winspy Suite control panelAnother malware project dubbed Project 420 aka Dolphin developed, deployed and controlled an undisclosed mobile malware capable of collecting and analyzing information about the activities of individuals and groups on social media networks including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and on messaging applications such as Telegram.","138":"According to leaked information, the regime not only developed tools for stealing sensitive data from its citizens, but also created designated platforms for the collection and analysis of the data.","139":"Another system mentioned in reports dubbed Shojreh includes a mapping of family relations of Jewish people in Iran and abroad.","140":"Additionally, the IRGC and MOIS gained unauthorized access to legitimate services or websites to spy on Iranian citizens.","141":"For example, the MOIS would compromise Iran\u2019s National Library computer network seeking to obtain personal information about users, mainly students and political prisoners, and their topics of interest.","142":"The MOIS allegedly also abused this access to send phishing emails with malicious attachments from the library\u2019s official email account.","143":"### Tracking Iranians Abroad","144":"In addition to all of the above, the Iranian government is making great efforts to monitor citizens going abroad by surveying and analyzing location data obtained from Iranian cellular operators with a system called Pouya, and by compromising the infrastructure of foreign companies.","145":"A screenshot from the Pouya systemIn 2019, an unknown activist or group of activists launched a site called \u201cVagheyatepenhaan\u201d (translated in Persian as \u2018the hidden facts\u2019) to expose Iranian regime espionage-related activity.","146":"The site contains a large section about espionage enterprises outside Iran that was conducted to monitor the movement of Iranians traveling abroad.","147":"According to this information, the regime gained access to computer systems of numerous airline companies in Bahrain, Dubai, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for data collection on flights of Iranian citizens.","148":"In another case, leaked documents showed the government worked on a project that aimed to compromise hotel websites in the Republic of Georgia, a neighboring country and a popular holiday destination for Iranians.","149":"While they can be considered revealing, It should be noted that these leaks provide a very narrow window into the full extent of the Iranian regime\u2019s priorities.","150":"Recently, there have been many vendor security advisories containing multiple critical vulnerabilities potentially impacting organizations that may be conflicted with patch prioritization when looking at the variables seen for each reported vulnerability.","151":"For instance, our vulnerability intelligence product uses information disclosed by vendor advisories, open source repositories and research companies\u2019 analyses to determine a certain level of risk, but we also take into consideration the scope of underground activity that can be seen surrounding critical vulnerability announcements.","152":"It is important to note that our risk assessment is assigned as a probability of current, active exploitation versus organization-specific risk.","153":"Over the course of a year, we observed consistency across underground activity responding to critical vulnerability disclosures and leading up to exploit development.","154":"These indicators could further help identify potential elevation of risk to your organization by recognizing events such as spikes of activity that commonly occur prior to successful exploitation attempts.","155":"After the initial open source disclosure of a critical vulnerability that reportedly received the highest severity rating available, a pattern of activity can be observed in the underground.","156":"Additionally, there are several forum threads started where threat actors discuss the possibility of exploitation or seek partners to assist in the development of proof of concept (PoC) and exploit code that leverage the newly announced vulnerability.","157":"Closely following these discussions, several threat actors will advertise claims of PoCs and exploits that have successfully been developed, however, claims within this timeframe are typically false.","158":"After this initial deluge of information, activity surrounding mentions of the vulnerability slows and there are fewer observed reposts of open source information.","159":"For example, an actor will claim to have an exploit for a recently disclosed critical vulnerability, including the common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) ID or its alias in the initial post.","160":"Vendors and vulnerability researchers likely would include information of existing credible exploit development and successful exploitation of a vulnerability.","161":"These sources also may expedite the development of exploits, such as when you see a successful PoC released after patching information for impacted products is provided by the vendor.","162":"Threat actors will share links to open source PoCs or exploits in response to the initial sales post and will leave comments such as \u201cthis is a rip off,\u201d \u201cit must be fake, you can get this for free\u201d and more.","163":"Notably, successful exploit development does not necessarily indicate all interested financially motivated cybercriminals will leverage the vulnerability for attacks.","164":"While there might be an increase in exploitation attempts, many threat actors will lack the sophistication required to take their interest to the next level.","165":"As the disclosure to exploit cycle ends, reporting on threat actors successfully leveraging the vulnerability in attack techniques and procedures may be delayed.","166":"Attackers can be cautious and use nonspecific details if they report initial entry methods at all, such as claiming to leverage a type of vulnerability or only providing the name of the vulnerable system.","167":"Evidence of this activity allows us to identify threat actors that claim to leverage a specific vulnerability to carry out consistently intrusive cybercriminal activity.","168":"The threat intelligence variables that add contextual risk to critical vulnerability prioritization can be cumbersome if your organization is affected by many recent advisories.","169":"This will naturally increase an actor\u2019s interest in the vulnerability and will not solely be based on the criticality of the reported CVE.","170":"2.Indicator two \u2013 Increase in observed underground conversations and posts related to the reported vulnerability.","171":"3.Indicator three \u2013 Fake and private development and sale of PoC and exploit code.","172":"This identifies a clear objective from threat actors seeking to leverage the vulnerability for future attacks.","173":"4.Indicator four \u2013 Publicly available, legitimate PoC code and threat actors claiming they are attempting to use this code for exploit development.","174":"Additionally, you might begin to see reporting on a small number of threat actors leveraging this vulnerability in attacks.","175":"This Citrix Application Delivery Controller, Citrix Gateway and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP appliance vulnerability, CVE-2019-19781, was disclosed in December 2019 and last updated in the U.S.","176":"In December 2019, we began to see less sophisticated threat actors share information from open source reports about CVE-2019-19781 and new forum threads started where actors sought to buy an exploit for the vulnerability.","177":"Discussions about the potential exploitation of the vulnerability continued until a publicly available exploit was observed in January 2020 and subsequently shared in the underground.","178":"This vulnerability continues to be high risk to organizations with unpatched affected Citrix systems.","179":"We reported on threat actors who claimed this vulnerability allowed them access into vulnerable systems as they attempted to move laterally through impacted networks.","180":"* A long-standing member of the Russian-language underground community started a post thread where the actor advertised funds available to purchase an exploit for the Citrix vulnerability.","181":"* A prolific seller of network access possibly leveraged the vulnerability to gain unauthorized network access to several organizations.","182":"* An exploit for the Citrix vulnerability was publicly available.","183":"An actor posted the GitHub link on a previously opened post thread and several actors circulated exploits for the vulnerability.","184":"* An actor shared several code variants for CVE-2019-19781.","185":"This actor commonly shares copied PoC and exploit code from open sources including Exploit DB, Packet Storm and GitHub.","186":"* A Russian-speaking actor was suspected to have leveraged the Citrix vulnerability after released compromised access revealed the impacted company uses Citrix System Software, however, the assessment was not confirmed.","187":"The actor claimed to use publicly available code for exploitation after scanning the internet for vulnerable hosts.","188":"* A handful of actors, including a notable threat actor with a positive underground reputation, claimed responsibility for many compromised network accesses likely using the Citrix vulnerability as an initial attack vector into compromised victim organizations.","189":"The F5 Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI), also referred to as the Configuration utility, reportedly had an RCE vulnerability in multiple versions of BIG-IP that was disclosed publicly as CVE-2020-5902 June 30, 2020.","190":"This vulnerability quickly cycled through the priority indicators of underground activity, which added to the vulnerability\u2019s criticality and overall risk of possible exploitation.","191":"The vendor reported the vulnerability with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) of 10.0, the highest score a CVE can receive.","192":"The F5 vulnerability allowed unauthenticated attackers or authenticated users with network access to execute arbitrary system commands, create or delete files, disable services and execute arbitrary Java code.","193":"Although the vendor released fixed versions and mitigation information, there was rapid development of exploit code and implementation into an attack framework.","194":"Following common trends, several actors shared information from multiple open source reports that discussed the vulnerability, an actor shared an alleged nmap exploit for CVE-2020-5902.","195":"Because the vulnerability was quickly productized and there was evidence of threat actors attempting to leverage the CVE in attacks, the overall risk of exploitation score is high.","196":"An actor posted an alleged nmap exploit for the F5 BIG-IP vulnerability stating: \u201cHere I\u2019m posting nmap script to exploit it.","197":"I am loving this vulnerability.","198":"*

access to target networks, downloading valuable files and deploying the actual ransomware, while the REvil gang handles victim negotiations and blackmailing, ransom collection and distribution.","347":"This model has apparently led to skyrocketing profits: according to the REvil representative, one affiliate's earnings rose from about US$20,000 to US $30,000 per target with another RaaS offering to about US $7 million to $8 million per target in only six months after joining forces with REvil.","348":"Intel 471 has linked REvil to 230 ransomware attacks in 2020.","349":"**Ryuk**","350":"The name \u201cRyuk\u201d could arguably be categorized as synonymous with ransomware, as the variant is one of the most popular, with a strong affiliate program and a large list of victims.","351":"It is often delivered as the last action in the chain of infections brought on by dueling use of the Trickbot botnet and Emotet malwares.","352":"Recently, we have also witnessed that Ryuk is delivered through the Bazar loader.","353":"Affiliates follow a model in their attacks: Hiring actors to launch spam campaigns to deliver the actor's banking malware.","354":"Then, another set of actors conduct privilege escalation attacks within compromised corporate networks.","355":"Then, teams of as many of five deploy the ransomware and handle negotiations with victims.","356":"Ryuk has exploded over the past year, responsible for millions of ransomware incidents around the world.","357":"Some security researchers estimate that Ryuk has been found in as much as one-third of ransomware attacks launched this year.","358":"One of the biggest threats from Ryuk this year has been focused on the healthcare sector.","359":"The attack that drew the most headlines was the attack on Universal Health Services, one of the biggest hospital systems in the United States.","360":"In our next entry, Intel 471 will examine what a business goes through once it has to recover from a ransomware attack.","361":"Steal, then strike: Access merchants are first clues to future ransomware attacks","362":"While ransomware variants like REvil, Ryuk and DoppelPaymer have become household names for cybersecurity professionals, those deploying ransomware only represent part of the process by which criminals are forcing organizations to either pay them millions or watch their business go under.","363":"A key cog in this growing operation is the interdependency between those who specialize in selling access to compromised systems or stolen information, and those looking to launch ransomware attacks.","364":"Data gathered by Intel 471 points to a pattern in numerous ransomware attacks that have occurred in the past 18 months: Criminals in underground forums will advertise access to various breached organizations, and quickly turn to sell access to the highest bidder or strike a deal with an ransomware affiliate in order to share in any profits pulled from a successful payment.","365":"These partnerships have resulted in a flourishing submarket, where access to corporate networks is sold for six-figure sums directly or via a partnership and cut of paid ransoms.","366":"The compromised credentials are mostly obtained through attackers abusing flaws or security shortcomings in virtual private networks or remote desktop protocol endpoints, which provides the initial entry point into enterprise networks.","367":"Additionally, credential information can come from logs tied to infostealer malware, password spraying or other credential marketplaces in the criminal underground.","368":"Instances show that anywhere from one week to six months after access is obtained and advertised, other known actors on various underground forums look to use or purchase that access to launch ransomware attacks.","369":"The targets run the gamut of regions and economic sectors, with the pattern playing out in ransomware attacks on every continent.","370":"One of the highest-profile ransomware attacks to fit this pattern was the attack on Pemex, the state-run oil company based in Mexico.","371":"In November 2019, attackers hit Pemex with DoppelPaymer, demanding $4.5 million in bitcoin to decrypt and return the files.","372":"Intelligence from Intel 471 found that beginning in June 2019, a separate actor was advertising access to 1,500 Pemex servers and personal computers, as well as administrator privileges to the company\u2019s domains, for $150,000.","373":"Another actor Intel 471 had been tracking started asking for access to ransomware-as-a-service affiliate programs, stating that deployment of ransomware on compromised networks should potentially return much more money than just selling the access.","374":"Days after this, Intel471 learned the actor obtained and modified a version of Thanos, and allegedly deployed it against U.S. businesses.","375":"Over the past three months, this actor has frequently tried to sell access to compromised organizations, which range in location, size, and economic sector.","376":"Access merchant partnerships are not exclusive to any one particular ransomware variant or ransomware-as-a-service.","377":"Data from Intel 471 shows this pattern following attacks carried out with popular ransomware variants, such as DoppelPaymer, Maze, Netwalker, Ryuk and REvil, as well as lesser-known variants like LockBit, Nefilim, Pysa and Thanos.","378":"Now, it\u2019s becoming increasingly common for attackers to demand seven- and eight-figure ransoms, partly due to the need to pay off actors that have helped them obtain access to the victim\u2019s system.","379":"One such attack drives home this point: Intel 471 obtained a chat log from a ransomware attack launched last month where a company \u2014 a U.S.-based healthcare provider \u2014 offered to pay a ransom of just under $400,000.","380":"Despite the company\u2019s quick response, the ransomware crew was insulted by the offer and threatened to dump the entire cache of stolen documents unless the figure was pushed several million dollars higher.","381":"With their backs against the wall, the company eventually settled to pay $2 million in bitcoin.","382":"How long ransomware crews decide to stay with this partnership model will be something to watch in the coming year.","383":"Intel 471 has observed actions in underground marketplaces that show RaaS groups are beginning to undercut access merchants, by either purchasing their own credential-stealing malware or recruiting teams that specialize in obtaining access.","384":"Additionally, ensuring token-based multi-factor authentication is enabled across an enterprise and scrutinizing all internet-facing remote network connections like RDP can be vital in preventing ransomware attacks.","385":"*This article was part of a series on ransomware attacks in 2020.","386":"[Part

methods or platforms, but behaves differently in large part due to the caution that actors take with regard to their identity.","391":"While the average citizen must follow the heavy handed nature of the government's surveillance of cyberspace, Chinese threat actors take special precautions to protect their forums, TTPs and themselves.","392":"This leads to the Chinese cybercrime underground being disorderly when compared to others, particularly Russia, which tend to be much more organized.","393":"Forums hosted on the Tor network have barriers to entry for most Chinese users as the government blocks Tor on the Chinese internet.","394":"In order for actors operating in mainland China to access these services, they need a VPN or similar measure capable of evading government detection.","395":"However, if actors do break through \u2014 or are operating from other popular Chinese cybercriminal hubs like Hong Kong, Malaysia, Myanmar, The Philippines, and Taiwan \u2014 there are a host of forums used by cybercriminals.","396":"DeepMix Market is one of the most well-known Chinese underground marketplaces, even after disappearing for several weeks in 2019 after a sustained DDoS attack.","397":"### United Chinese Escrow Market","398":"The United Chinese Escrow Market, or UCEM, was established in June 2018 to sell goods and services like those on DeepMix, but differs in that users can set up their own independent shops instead of relying on one central purchasing hub.","399":"Marketplace postings are listed in U.S. dollars, but bitcoin is the only accepted currency for transactions, with an exchange rate determined by a third-party payment service provider.","400":"The site also has functions similar to other ecommerce sites, including sections where users can discuss their transaction experience, an internal mailbox function to communicate with other members, a bitcoin wallet management section.","401":"Earlier this year, Intel 471 saw a number of marketplace users spin up Telegram channels that were affiliated with the site, made in order to provide an extra layer of security when discussing listings or other site-related matters.","402":"Free City is similar to Tea Horse Road, particularly due to use of Telegram channels.","403":"The Telegram channels allow users to discuss what's for sale in the forums, while also hosting tutorials and other information related to making purchases.","404":"Open web hacking forums where Chinese cybercriminals congregate do exist, but often get shut down by the Chinese government.","405":"There have been numerous initiatives launched under Chinese President Xi Jinping that have led to the crackdown of what the government has deemed to be illicit internet content.","406":"In April 2020, China's Ministry of Public Security announced it punished 1,522 people for public security and notified other departments to give 433 party and political sanctions for matters related to cybercrime.","407":"Some of the more popular open web forums, like HLODAY or HZDG (\u534e\u4e2d\u5e1d\u56fd, also known as China Central Empire), have gone down during this time.","408":"More often, skilled Chinese actors make their way to international forums, such as Exploit, Hack Forums, Raid Forums and XSS. These actors advertise tools and services like any other member: compromised payment cards, information or data, ransomware, cryptomining malware and more.","409":"The Telegram channels tied to Tor services is indicative of another trend: Chinese actors like to use messaging clients to converse with each other in the underground.","410":"This is partly due to the familiarity of the greater Chinese population with messaging platforms like WeChat and QQ, which are extremely popular among Chinese internet users.","411":"Therefore, we have seen Chinese actors move to non-native messaging services like Telegram.","412":"Because of the anonymity and censorship circumvention needed to develop and sell malware or stolen data, Chinese actors have learned to be extremely adaptable.","413":"The Chinese government's efforts to watch its population's internet activity means there is no anonymous access, since an IP address can be tied to an actual person.","414":"This results in the anonymity of a Chinese actor being \"thinner\" than in other areas of the world.","415":"In order to evade detection, Chinese actors will change IP addresses by joining different WiFi networks and getting modems to request a new dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) addresses, use the TOR network, leverage VPN and proxy services to bypass the Great Firewall, use codewords to avoid keyword filters, and tools such as shadowsocks relay (ssr) and V2Ray.","416":"Additionally, the fact that some actors do manage to bypass the censorship measures and access international sites and services means that although the latest tools and techniques are available to the Chinese underground, not everyone has access to them.","417":"This has led to a trend of Chinese actors modifying source code of freeware and malware families to develop their own versions for use, distribution and sale, or using popular forums such as GitHub to refine their skills, fine tune tools or access the latest malware.","418":"Because getting around the Great Firewall can be so difficult, a lot of the malware being pushed on Chinese cybercriminal underground forums is built upon existing tools.","419":"Intel 471 has observed numerous Remote Access Trojans (RATs) that are variants of already known malware or pentesting tools, such as:","420":"* Anubis","421":"* AsyncRAT","422":"* Cobalt Strike","423":"* Gh0st","424":"* Gray Pigeon","425":"* Gray Wolf","426":"* NjRAT","427":"* Spynote","428":"We also observed popular tools such as worms, brute forcers, DDoS tools and post-exploitation tools, as well as exploits for vulnerabilities in web servers for Apache, Oracle and Microsoft Windows.","429":"There was also interest in software that mines cryptocurrencies while also attempting to steal wallets or credentials to access online wallets.","430":"Additionally, both international (GandCrab, WannaCry) and domestic (FilesLocker) variants of ransomware were placed on various forums.","431":"As long as the Chinese government shows the ability and desire to crack down on its population's internet activity, highly-skilled actors will continue to closely guard their skills and identity in an effort to avoid being caught.","432":"With the censorship and surveillance practices carried out by the Chinese government unlikely to stop, the variety of forums, as well as different TTPs employed by actors, likely will continue to adapt and evolve in order to make as much money as possible.","433":"The above information has been pulled from an Intel 471 whitepaper that has further in-depth information on the Chinese cybercrime underground.","434":"On December 17, an image adorned the shop's website that claimed the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Interpol had taken it into law enforcement's possession.","435":"\"This could be a result of many things, from the pandemic to the massive shift of many cybercriminals to ransomware, where significantly less effort can lead to marginally higher profits.","436":"\"Payment card fraud has shifted its attention to e-commerce targets due to a handful of factors including the pandemic forcing consumers to stay at home, and the rise of Magecart-type attacks,\" said a security expert in the financial services industry who asked to remain anonymous.","437":"TA505\u2019s modified loader means new attack campaign could be coming","438":"After months of inactivity, hacking group TA505's Get2 Loader has sprung back into operation, possibly signaling that the group is ready for a new round of malicious activity.","439":"On December 14, 2020, the Get2 loader had resurfaced with new download and execute configuration parameters named \"LD\" and \"ED.","440":"The \"LD\" parameter reflectively loads a downloaded dynamic-link library (DLL) file into the address space of the current process and calls its entry point.","441":"The \"ED\" parameter copies the DLL into executable memory and invokes the entry point directly.","442":"The preexisting \"RD\" parameter that was used to inject the downloaded DLL into EXCEL.EXE can now perform injection into WINWORD.EXE as well.","443":"The reconfigured loader is meant to allow the group to carry out its operations without drawing the attention of enterprise defenses.","444":"In the past, it has been used to download the SDBbot, FlawedGrace and other malware.","445":"TA505 is a prolific Russian-speaking, financially-motivated group that is known for launching large-scale targeted attacks.","446":"The group [was most recently discovered](https:\/\/www.darkreading.com\/attacks-breaches\/ta505-targets-hr-departments-with-poisoned-cvs-\/d\/d-id\/1337355) going after German-speaking targets with weaponized CVs.","447":"Intel 471 also observed the group going after targets in Japan, South Korea, United Arab Emirates in 2019.","448":"Drawing from past experiences, Intel 471 believes that new, undiscovered malware campaigns will follow with the introduction of the reconfigured Get2 Loader.","449":"\"TA505 can be somewhat deliberate in how they operate, more so than most of the financially-motivated groups we track,\" said Intel 471 COO Jason Passwaters.","450":"The Intel 471 adversary intelligence on major threat groups such as TA505 and our unique insight into its capabilities, intent and motivations, can be leveraged by threat intelligence teams to remain proactive and resilient against attacks as cybercriminals modify TTPs.","451":"Nation-states are taking their supply-chain attack strategy from the cybercriminal underground","452":"It\u2019s clear the SolarWinds incident has rocked the infosec community to its core, with the still-unfolding episode expected to reverberate in the industry for years to come.","453":"While there is still much to be uncovered, the public details point to [a known Russian APT](https:\/\/www.cisa.gov\/news\/2021\/01\/05\/joint-statement-federal-bureau-investigation-fbi-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure) inserting code into a third-party IT provider\u2019s services, allowing for further targeting of approximately 50 organizations.","454":"This type of incident, commonly referred to as a \u201csupply-chain attack,\u201d has been the cornerstone in some of the biggest security incidents of the past decade.","455":"There has been a rise in events the past few years where actors aligned with governments are using supply-chain attacks for nation-state-level work.","456":"The most well-known supply-chain attacks of the past decade are now security parables: Russian-linked criminals have attacked ATMs for years with [different types](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2014\/oct\/08\/cash-machine-atm-malware-tyupkin) [of malware](https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/538ebn\/atm-hack-russia-disappearing-malware).","457":"An unidentified hacking group was able to [breach a casino through a fish tank](https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2017\/07\/19\/technology\/fish-tank-hack-darktrace\/index.html) that was connected to the internet.","458":"A litany of e-commerce sites, from Ticketmaster to British Airways to OXO, had the JavaScript in [their third-party payment forms](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/magecart-amazon-cloud-hacks\/) hijacked in order to send credit card information to various criminal groups.","459":"Criminals aren\u2019t only trying to go after payment information in their supply chain attacks.","460":"In August 2019, attackers hit a managed services provider that worked with local government agencies [in 22 Texas towns](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2019\/08\/20\/752695554\/23-texas-towns-hit-with-ransomware-attack-in-new-front-of-cyberassault), launching a ransomware attack that brought city services and financial actions to a halt.","461":"That attack was carried out through [a version of the MSP\u2019s remote access tool](https:\/\/www.crn.com\/news\/channel-programs\/msp-at-center-of-texas-ransomware-hit-we-take-care-of-our-customers-#:~:text=Master%20MSP%20IT%20By%20Design,ransomware%20to%20recover%20its%20systems.), which attackers got access to during a different supply chain attack in June 2019.","462":"The devastating NotPetya attack was launched in part via a supply chain attack, when Ukrainian accounting software MeDoc was breached, resulting in a software update release that was laced with malware being pushed to users.","463":"The U.S. government estimated the attack, which crippled a slew of international companies, [caused $10 billion worth of damage](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world\/).","464":"The act is largely believed to have been conducted by the Russian government.","465":"The NotPetya attack was a watershed moment that has served as the blueprint for how supply chain attacks have become a well-worn tool of those conducting espionage or acting on behalf of a government.","466":"Intel 471 has seen an uptick in these actions over the past few years, well before SolarWinds commanded the community\u2019s attention.","467":"A stark example of this behavior comes from a prolific actor with suspected ties to the Iranian government.","468":"The actor boasted that he obtained this access by finding it when they used a password-spraying technique against large numbers of Office 365 and Citrix account interfaces.","469":"They also claimed to obtain access via RDP, and in web-based exploits, bypassing antivirus detection and exploiting already compromised email accounts that lack two-factor authentication.","470":"The tactics, techniques and procedures used by this actor links them to the Mabna Institute, an Iranian government contractor that has been responsible for coordinated attack campaigns since 2013.","471":"[Citrix told its customers last year](https:\/\/krebsonsecurity.com\/2020\/02\/hackers-were-inside-citrix-for-five-months\/) that it found hackers were its systems for months in order to claim a foothold in other enterprise systems.","472":"Another alleged government-linked group started taking advantage of supply chain attacks even before NotPetya.","473":"In 2017, there were several incidents targeting ATMs across South Korea, after two software vendors were compromised.","474":"The malware eventually allowed the perpetrators to gain access to 2,500 accounts at a major international bank, which were then used for an unspecified number of fraudulent transfers.","475":"Intel 471 found that actors possibly linked to North Korea found a way to manipulate the companies\u2019 antivirus update server that allowed them to upload a remote access trojan (RAT) to the compromised ATM machines.","476":"Allowing cybercriminals to operate with their own skills and tools allows governments to save money in training and development, leveraging capabilities and a \u201cworkforce\u201d they don\u2019t have to build themselves.","477":"But a key asset is also the ability to \u201chide in the noise\u201d created by cybercriminals and the marketplaces they frequently use.","478":"If the TTPs of a supply chain attack bear the hallmarks of financially-motivated actors, governments are given an extra layer of protection, plausible deniability and obfuscation from being labeled as responsible for a particular incident.","479":"While the SolarWinds incident will be pored over in the months to come, it is only one in a growing list of incidents that show that not only are supply-chain attacks a common practice, they are effective for both financially-motivated criminals and government-backed campaigns alike.","480":"Intel 471 has previously observed criminal actors advertising access to SolarWinds, years before this current incident was alleged to begin.","481":"Emotet takedown is not like the Trickbot takedown","482":"On Wednesday, January 27, U.S. and European law enforcement agencies [announced](https:\/\/www.europol.europa.eu\/newsroom\/news\/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action) that they had seized control of Emotet, the notorious botnet that\u2019s been used by cybercriminals all over the world for the past decade.","483":"Based on the information available to Intel 471, the law enforcement operation took place Jan. 26, 2021, resulting in the arrest of several Ukrainian nationals allegedly responsible for running the botnet\u2019s infrastructure.","484":"Only time will tell if the takedown will have a long-term impact on Emotet operations.","485":"Emotet itself does not appear to have any sort of recovery mechanism, but a lot of the infected machines will have other malware installed as well, such as Qbot, [Trickbot](https:\/\/intel471.com\/blog\/trickbot-update-november-2020-bazar-loader-microsoft\/) or something else.","486":"Cybercriminals are interested in your SCADA systems","487":"The public learned this week of an alarming cybersecurity incident that could have physically harmed people: Someone managed to access a system that controlled a Florida city\u2019s water treatment plant, temporarily adjusting sodium hydroxide levels to amounts that could have made the population sick had the chemicals been introduced into the water supply.","488":"Within the last year, Intel 471 has seen financially-motivated actors attempt to sell access to SCADA systems tied to water treatment plants.","489":"In May 2020, we observed a likely Iranian actor attempt to sell access to a U.S. \u201chydroelectric power plant.","490":"Further investigation found that what the actor was actually advertising was access to a water treatment plant in Florida, via a virtual network computing (VNC) permission that granted system access to a \u201cGroundwater Recovery & Treatment System.","491":"To be clear: Although Intel 471 could not definitively confirm or deny a link between the access offered by the actor and the Oldsmar, Florida incident, there was no information that directly tied the two events together at the time this report was published.","492":"The actor shared this information in a Telegram channel that is known for cyberattacks and account cracking.","493":"It\u2019s the same channel that has been [tied to a December 2020 incident](https:\/\/www.securityweek.com\/iranian-hackers-access-unprotected-ics-israeli-water-facility) where actors allegedly had access to an unprotected human-machine interface (HMI) system at an Israeli water reservoir.","494":"Although threat actors do not often openly discuss this type of activity, there are those who seek to target ICS or SCADA systems in order to build credibility in the cybercriminal underground.","495":"Actors with even a rudimentary understanding of how to use Shodan, a search engine designed to find internet-connected systems, or where to find stolen or default credentials can obtain access to industrial control systems that could lead to incidents like what happened in Oldsmar, Florida.","496":"If we were to list all of the malicious acts carried out by cybercriminals who leverage bulletproof hosting (BPH), we\u2019d have a report that would rival \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d or \u201cWar & Peace\u201d for length.","497":"Banking Trojans","498":"One of the most common malware families on the internet, banking trojans have been around as long as bulletproof hosting.","499":"While both bulletproof hosting and banking trojans have evolved, they\u2019ve been linked together for nearly 15 years.","500":"Some of the most popular banking trojans that take advantage of bulletproof hosting are:","501":"* **Silent Night\/ZLoader:** One of the most ubiquitous banking trojans currently in existence, actors are using bulletproof hosting in conjunction with ZLoader.","502":"Intel 471 has observed a Russian-speaking actor leverage bulletproof hosting for a website that is linked in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet sent to phishing targets.","503":"Once visited, the website drops ZLoader on a victim\u2019s machine.","504":"* **DanaBot**: This banking trojan is the work of a fluent Russian-speaking actor that works with several other persons to offer a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform.","505":"In 2018, the author stated on an underground forum that he relied on bulletproof hoster IronHost for the trojan\u2019s command-and-control infrastructure.","506":"IronHost, a now defunct brand that has operated under many different fronts, is thought to be linked to a long-standing BPH service based in Moldova that has changed names numerous times since 2008.","507":"Additionally, Intel 471 found DanaBot samples in 2019 that were hosted on infrastructure belonging to a different, well-known bulletproof hosting provider.","508":"* **GozNym:** Known as more of a hybrid, GozNym was two separate malicious programs modified and merged together: a malware downloader (Nymaim) and a banking trojan variant (Gozi ISFB).","509":"The crew behind GozNym were known to leverage a very popular fast-flux hosting botnet called Avalanche until the malicious hosting service was brought down by [law enforcement](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2016\/12\/took-4-years-take-avalanche-huge-online-crime-ring\/) in late 2016.","510":"The GozNym cybercrime network itself would later be dismantled by international law enforcement [in late 2019](https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/pr\/goznym-cyber-criminal-network-operating-out-europe-targeting-american-entities-dismantled).","511":"Information Stealers","512":"While, in a sense, all banking trojans are information stealers, not all information stealers are banking trojans.","513":"Cybercriminals have found ways to make money off information that isn\u2019t directly tied to banking services, due partly to BPH infrastructure that allows it to proliferate.","514":"* **AZORult:** A notorious information stealer, its main function to steal credentials from victim machines and download or execute additional payloads.","515":"While it\u2019s impossible to track all deployments of AZORult, one of the most prolific BPH hosters on the internet, CCWeb, has hosted web domains that have sent users the malware.","516":"CCWeb is currently the only bot-based, double-flux hosting botnet offered in the underground marketplace.","517":"* **VIDAR:** An information stealer which was advertised for sale on various forums in October 2018, its primary functionality is to steal form data and stored credentials from common software such as email clients, FTP clients and web browsers.","518":"Hosted by the developers, VIDAR has deviated from other BPH models, buying inexpensive virtual private servers (VPS) until those are shut down by abuse complaints.","519":"It is unclear whether the VPS hosted the real VIDAR control server code or served as a proxy.","520":"* **Baldr:** An information stealer that had a short-but-popular run, the Russian-linked malware developer would offer discounts to those who bought his product and hosted it on BraZZZerS, a well-known BPH provider.","521":"Ransomware","522":"Currently the most pervasive form of cybercrime, ransomware operations would not be possible without a helping hand from BPH providers.","523":"* **DarkSide:** One of the newest ransomware gangs in the cybercriminal underground, the author relies on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model in order to make as much money as possible.","524":"One actor that has claimed to be the malware\u2019s operator uses a custom PowerShell script that could exfiltrate data about a compromised system and run commands from a remote command and control (C2) server.","525":"The website used to drop that script is hosted in an IP range that has been used by two prominent BPH providers, MoreneHost and Yalishanda.","526":"* **NEMTY\/NEFILIM:** Between March and April 2020, Intel 471 discovered that an affiliate of the NEMTY ransomware service was running a blog used to disclose victim data.","527":"That blog was run on BraZZZerS until the operators closed down the ransomware for good.","528":"In May, when the NEFILIM ransomware variant was used, a new blog was launched, albeit hosted by a different BPH service.","529":"* **Maze:** Much like NEMTY\/NEFILIM, operators of Maze ran a blog that publicly announced victims.","530":"The blog stopped operating once the Maze gang moved onto an updated version, known as Egregor.","531":"BPH providers also can be tied to the following: carding shops, virtual credit card skimmers, phishing sites, DDoS attacks and spam campaigns, among others.","532":"But by gaining stronger familiarity with the most popular services used by cybercriminals, and monitoring for significant activity stemming from their infrastructure, security practitioners can better formulate a proactive plan to guard against these crimes and law enforcement can better hone attempts to permanently take the machines offline.","533":"EtterSilent: the underground\u2019s new favorite maldoc builder","534":"The latest \u201cproduct\u201d is a malicious document builder, known in the underground as \u201cEtterSilent,\u201d that Intel 471 has seen leveraged by various cybercrime groups.","535":"First advertised on a well-known Russian cybercrime forum, the seller offered two types of weaponized Microsoft Office documents (maldocs) to users: one that exploits a known vulnerability in Microsoft Office ([CVE-2017-8570](https:\/\/msrc.microsoft.com\/update-guide\/vulnerability\/CVE-2017-8570)) and another that uses a malicious macro.","536":"To our knowledge, the maldoc with the macro is the more popular choice, possibly due to lower pricing and higher compatibility when compared to the exploit.","537":"The malicious document, when opened, shows a template that poses as DocuSign, the popular software that allows individuals and organizations to electronically sign documents.","538":"The maldoc then leverages Excel 4.0 macros stored in a hidden sheet, which allow an externally-hosted payload to be downloaded, written to disk and executed using regsvr32 or rundll32.","539":"EtterSilent DocuSign template from December 2020","540":"EtterSilent DocuSign template from March 2021### A cybercrime extravaganza","541":"Ettersilent is being used in many malware campaigns, many of which will be familiar to most cybersecurity experts.","542":"It was used in a recent spam campaign to drop an updated version of Trickbot.","543":"The maldoc was attached in an email that pretended to be from a well-known multinational appliance manufacturer, claiming to be a payment invoice.","544":"On March 19, 2021, EtterSilent was used as part of a Bazar loader campaign.","545":"The maldoc downloads the Bazar payload, which in turn connects to another URL that downloads the related Bazar backdoor.","546":"Three banking trojans \u2014 BokBot, Gozi ISFB and QBot \u2014have also used EtterSilent in conjunction with their schemes.","547":"Intel 471 tracked a particular campaign tied to BokBot that had numerous distribution URLs embedded in the EtterSilent maldocs.","548":"The usage of Yalishanda\u2019s BPH service specifically for the delivery URL is reminiscent of years worth of Hancitor campaigns observed by Intel 471.","549":"EtterSilent\u2019s attachment to [Yalishanda](https:\/\/intel471.com\/blog\/top-bulletproof-hosting-providers-yalishanda-ccweb-brazzzers-2021\/) is another example of that notion.","550":"The widespread use of EtterSilent shows how commoditization is a big part of the cybercrime economy.","551":"| Trickbot payload | 9118198afca6e2479fdbcca55a08a4408570d2186a7dd8f261f1821178deb595 |","552":"| Trickbot

since then the follow-up has been carried out during the last few months.","576":"This group attacks the Middle East and does not use very sophisticated mechanisms, at least in the campaign started in August 2018 which was monitored.","577":"It is considered unsophisticated by the fact that the scripts are unobtrusive, communications go unencrypted by HTTP, they use Powershell (increasingly monitored), and so on.","578":"We must be aware that once these scripts are executed, it is when the behavior analysis of many solutions will detect them, but this fact has not been studied by LAB52.","579":"This actor in all the artifacts analyzed shows his victims a decoy document in Arabic with different themes.","580":"As indicated above, during the month of August 2018 S2 Grupo CERT we managed an incident aimed at the diplomacy of different Middle Eastern countries.","581":"The attackers used a malware made in Visual Basic Script (VBS) as a tool to control the victim.","582":"Starting from the study of this VBS from S2 Grupo CERT, the monitoring of this group was started, finding in other sources other artifacts from the same group but with different decoy documents and with different strategies of execution, persistence, and so on.","583":"S2 Grupo does not have enough information to make any type of attribution or authorship.","584":"It is associated that these artifacts are related because they reflect similarities from a technical and temporal point of view and because of the decoy documents used, since sometimes they are identical.","585":"One aspect observed during the investigation is that the attackers after running the VBS used it as an Empire post-exploitation framework (<https:\/\/github.com\/EmpireProject\/Empire>).","586":"A total of five scripts plus the one involved in the incident could be collected.","587":"![](https:\/\/lab52.es\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/wirte_img01.png)","588":"In this case the file was

in the very signature of the document.","609":"It was also apparently addressed to the Kuwaiti Consulate of the Cooperation Council of the Arab States of the Gulf, a highly important body within the countries of the Persian Gulf.","610":"The text mentions that attached, the recipient will find a document from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs called \u201cHajj affairs\u201d, which is of

generate an infection among the \u201cpartner states\u201d of Saudi Arabia; **the \u201ctarget\u201d of the issuer could be the members of the diplomatic corps of countries with interest in the \u201cHajj\u201d** and especially the diplomats who are part of the Cooperation Council of the Arab States of the Gulf, since the issuer promotes the forwarding of the document to all interested parties.","613":"One of them is the \u201cHajj\u201d, which implies that all Muslims must visit Mecca at least once in their lifetime.","614":"This monument is located in the Jeddah region within Saudi Arabia.","615":"**The date of issuance of the document is relevant** as it was held in August, approximately two weeks before the great pilgrimage, just when thousands of people of Muslim faith would begin the pilgrimage to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.","616":"![](https:\/\/lab52.es\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/wirte_img04.png)","617":"In this case the file has been uploaded from

Lab52 has been monitoring an infection campaign that is using different kinds of threats.","833":"One of these threats is Vengeance Justice Worm, also known as Vjw0rm, which is developed in Javascript.","834":"This is a type of malware capable of acting as a RAT or spreading through removable devices, thus doing worm functions, among others.","835":"[1] Its second main threat is Hallaj Pro RAT, a modified version of the well-known NJRat Trojan, which consists of a remote control tool known since 2013, and developed in .NET, and which has been seen on multiple occasions related to campaigns carried out against the Middle East.","836":"The starting point of our investigation is the appearance of the command and control domain \u201clalik.linkpc[.]net\u201d in two samples found

versions of NJRat.","840":"A pattern can also be observed in the geographical distribution of the IP addresses to which each of the domains has resolved in recent months Can be seen how for each domain, there is a set of addresses located in the same country in the Middle East.","841":"In addition, all these sets of addresses in each country share several IPs in France that act as a link between the different domains.","842":"Some interesting information has been obtained from the analysis of the samples of modified NJRat that were related to the domains and IP addresses previously investigated.","843":"The capabilities presented by the analyzed samples are wide, allowing to act as a keylogger, execute native commands, take screenshots or use the camera, among many other options.","844":"The string \u201ctekide\u201d and \u201cHallaj Pro RAT [Fixed]\u201d were found in the process memory of many of the samples.","845":"A quick search of the string \u201ctekide\u201d

permission of Russia and its popular operation against the DNC, China has become the main actor in cyberspace, developing an uncountable number of operations against all kind of sectors as: IT, military or naval industries and different governmental organizations.","1122":"According to traditional ancient texts, Chinese civilization dates back more than 4,000 years with the first Xia dynasty.","1123":"Due to the continuity and strength of its political and social structure, the protection of its historical and cultural legacy and the practically null western influence until the 19th century, the Chinese Empire is considered the oldest empire that exists.","1124":"The historical endurance of the Chinese empire has not been based solely on military victories, but on its peculiar way of understanding resistance to foreign invasion.","1125":"As an example, the Qing Dynasty, the last Chinese dynasty that ruled between 1644 and 1912, was founded by the Aisin-Gioro clan of Manchuria (the Manchus are currently an ethnic minority) and not by the Chinese population as it could be though.","1126":"Similarly, the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) was founded by Mongol invaders, heirs to the legacy of Genghis Khan.","1127":"Despite this, the language, customs and tradition remained unchanged thanks to the Chinese bureaucratic elites, who offered their services to the invaders with the excuse of the difficulty that would supposed to control a country with such dimensions, and making the only condition to maintain their methods and language.","1128":"Because of this, the second-generation of invaders would assimilate the culture, coming to be seen as outsiders by their home territories, and finally, ending up defending China\u2019s national

technological world scenario with to the United States as well, leading the deployment of 5G by the hand of Huawei.","1131":"As the comparison mentioned by the former head of the Canadian Intelligence and Security Service for Asia-Pacific, Michel Juneau-Katsua, if Western intelligence had to steal a beach, he would go at night and wait for nobody to see him to steal it.","1132":"Hiding in broad

China is not interested in entering the Thucydides trap through a direct confrontation against the United States, but will use, as it has done in the past, the multipolar geopolitical scenario to achieve its purposes.","1136":"About to end the Korean War, Mao managed to gain a foothold on the international scene through a strategy very much in the line with the classic strategist Sun

known threat actors.","1484":"*Figure 1: Number of email messages associated with a Cobalt Strike payload observed over\u00a0time.","1485":"Threat actors\u00a0can obtain Cobalt Strike in a variety of ways:\u00a0purchasing it directly from the\u00a0vendor\u2019s\u00a0website, which requires verification;\u00a0buying\u00a0a version\u00a0on the dark web\u00a0via\u00a0various hacking forums;\u00a0or

Cobalt Strike\u2019s Appeal","1488":"Cobalt Strike is used by a diverse array of threat actors, and while it\u00a0is not unusual for cybercriminal and APT actors to leverage similar tooling in their campaigns, Cobalt Strike is unique in\u00a0that\u00a0\u00a0its\u00a0built-in capabilities\u00a0enable it to\u00a0be quickly deployed and operationalized regardless of actor sophistication or access to human or financial resources.","1489":"Cobalt Strike is also\u00a0session-based \u2014 that is, if threat actors can access a host and complete an operation without needing to establish ongoing persistence, there will not be remaining artifacts on the host after it is no longer running in-memory.","1490":"Threat actors can also use the malleability of Cobalt Strike to create customized builds that add or remove features to achieve objectives or evade detection.","1491":"For example, APT29 frequently uses custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loaders to\u00a0[blend in](https:\/\/www.fireeye.com\/blog\/threat-research\/2018\/11\/not-so-cozy-an-uncomfortable-examination-of-a-suspected-apt29-phishing-campaign.html)\u00a0with legitimate traffic or\u00a0[evade

unique signatures, so threat detection engineers may be required to play catch-up to Cobalt Strike use in the wild.","1493":"Cobalt Strike\u00a0is also\u00a0appealing to threat actors\u00a0for\u00a0its inherent obfuscation.","1494":"If\u00a0an organization has\u00a0a red team actively making use of it, it\u00a0is possible malicious traffic could be mistaken as

the full Cobalt Strike threat landscape.","1519":"*Figure 2: Timeline of threats using Cobalt Strike.","1520":"Proofpoint has observed dozens of threat actors using Cobalt Strike.","1521":"Threat actors use different lure themes, threat types, droppers, and payloads.","1522":"For example, the earliest Cobalt Strike campaigns distributed email threats with malicious document attachments to distribute the malware, but campaigns distributing malicious URLs directly in the email body have overtaken attachments as the more frequently utilized threat type.","1523":"While instances of Cobalt Strike being sent directly as an initial payload have dramatically increased, deployment as a second stage payload remains popular.","1524":"Cobalt Strike has been observed in a variety of attack chains alongside malware such as The Trick,\u00a0BazaLoader,\u00a0Ursnif,\u00a0IcedID, and many more popular loaders.","1525":"In these cases, the preceding malware typically loads and executes Cobalt Strike.","1526":"Likewise, there is a wide array of techniques leveraged in cases where Cobalt Strike is delivered directly, such as via malicious macros in weaponized Office documents, compressed executables, PowerShell, dynamic data exchange (DDE), HTA\/HTML files, and traffic distribution systems.","1527":"After Cobalt Strike has been executed and a\u00a0Beacon established\u00a0for C2 communication, actors have been observed attempting to enumerate network connections and dumping Active Directory credentials as they try to move laterally to a network resource such as a Domain Controller, allowing for deployment of ransomware to all networked systems.","1528":"For example, the Cobalt Strike\u00a0[documentation states](https:\/\/www.cobaltstrike.com\/help-beacon):\u00a0\u00a0","1529":"Use the net\u00a0dclist\u00a0command to find the\u00a0Domain\u00a0Controller for the domain the target is joined

functions into existing running host processes to attempt to avoid detection.","1533":"Proofpoint researchers anticipate Cobalt Strike will continue to be a commonly used tool in threat actor toolsets.","1534":"According to internal data,\u00a0tens of thousands of\u00a0organizations\u00a0have already been targeted\u00a0with\u00a0Cobalt Strike, based on observed campaigns.","1535":"*Figure 3: Number of customers targeted by threats using Cobalt Strike*","1536":"Cobalt Strike is a useful tool, for legitimate security researchers and threat actors alike.","1537":"Its malleability coupled with\u00a0its usability makes it a robust and effective tool for siphoning data, moving laterally, and\u00a0loading additional malware payloads.","1538":"Cobalt Strike is not the only red team tool appearing more often in\u00a0Proofpoint\u00a0data.","1539":"Others include Mythic, Meterpreter, and the Veil Framework.","1540":"The use of publicly available tooling aligns with a broader trend observed by Proofpoint:","1541":"Threat actors are using as many legitimate tools as possible, including executing Windows processes like PowerShell and WMI; injecting malicious code into legitimate

Conversation with TA453","1684":"* [TA453](https:\/\/www.proofpoint.com\/us\/blog\/threat-insight\/badblood-ta453-targets-us-and-israeli-medical-research-personnel-credential), an\u00a0Iranian - state\u00a0aligned actor,\u00a0masqueraded as British scholars\u00a0to covertly target individuals of intelligence interest to the Iranian government in what Proofpoint has dubbed Operation\u00a0SpoofedScholars.","1685":"* The email conversations were benign until TA453 provided a link to a compromised website hosting a credential harvesting page.","1686":"* The use of a legitimate but actor-compromised website is an increase in sophistication compared to TA453\u2019s historical Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures of using actor-controlled credential phishing websites.","1687":"* Proofpoint has worked with the appropriate authorities to conduct victim notification.","1688":"Masquerading as\u00a0UK scholars\u00a0with the University of London\u2019s\u00a0School of Oriental and African Studies\u00a0(SOAS), the\u00a0threat actor TA453 has been covertly approaching individuals\u00a0since\u00a0at least\u00a0January 2021 to solicit sensitive information.","1689":"The threat actor, an APT who we assess with high confidence supports Islamic\u00a0Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence collection efforts,\u00a0established backstopping for their credential phishing infrastructure by compromising a legitimate site of a highly regarded academic institution to deliver personalized credential harvesting pages disguised as registration links.","1690":"Identified targets included experts in Middle Eastern affairs from think tanks, senior professors from well-known academic institutions, and journalists specializing in Middle Eastern coverage.","1691":"Once the conversation was established, TA453 delivered a \u201cregistration link\u201d to a legitimate but compromised website belonging to the University of London\u2019s SOAS radio.","1692":"Of note, TA453 also targeted the personal email accounts of at least one of their targets.","1693":"In subsequent phishing\u00a0emails, TA453\u00a0shifted their tactics and\u00a0began delivering the registration link earlier\u00a0in their engagement with the target\u00a0without requiring extensive conversation.","1694":"This operation, dubbed\u00a0SpoofedScholars,\u00a0represents one of the more sophisticated TA453 campaigns\u00a0identified\u00a0by\u00a0Proofpoint.","1695":"### Chatting with TA453","1696":"In early 2021, a TA453 persona,\u00a0\u201cDr.Hanns\u00a0Bjoern\u00a0Kendel, Senior Teaching and Research Fellow at SOAS University in London,\u201d\u00a0used email address\u00a0hannse.kendel4[@]gmail.com\u00a0to solicit conversations\u00a0with targets.","1697":"The following is\u00a0a brief summary\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0example conversation\u00a0observed\u00a0by Proofpoint Threat Research:\u00a0","1698":"TA453\u00a0sent an initial email\u00a0trying to entice the target with a prospective invitation to an online conference on \u201cThe US Security Challenges in the Middle East.","1699":"TA453sent an initial email\u00a0trying to entice the target with a prospective invitation to an online conference on \u201cThe US Security Challenges in the Middle East.","1700":"TA453 strived to connect with the\u00a0individual\u00a0via phone to discuss the invitation; however, after the target hedged\u00a0and emphatically stated that they wanted a written proposal with the details, TA453 acquiesced with conference specifics.","1701":"After a little back and forth that verified the target\u2019s interest, TA453\u00a0provided a detailed invitation to the fake conference (Figure 1).","1702":"The conversation concluded with TA453 attempting to get the target to connect via\u00a0videoconferencing.","1703":"Throughout the conversation, Proofpoint identified a few interesting themes:\u00a0","1704":"* TA453 demonstrates passable English skills and is open to voice communication via videoconferencing.","1705":"* TA453 demonstrates an interest in mobile phone numbers, possibly for mobile malware or additional phishing.","1706":"* TA453 repeatedly demonstrated a desire to connect with the target in real-time.","1707":"In addition to\u00a0Hanns\u2019 solicitations, at least one target received a credential harvesting email to their personal email account.","1708":"This attempt did not masquerade as Dr.\u00a0Kendel\u00a0but did still attempt to harvest credentials from the target.","1709":"Currently, Proofpoint does not have more information on this specific kill chain.","1710":"TA453 targets in\u00a0Operation\u00a0SpoofedScholars\u00a0can be clustered into three main categories that are consistent with the IRGC\u2019s historical collection priorities.","1711":"* Journalists focused on Middle Eastern affairs","1712":"These groupings consistently have information of interest to the Iranian government, including, but not limited to, information about foreign policy, insights into Iranian dissident movements, and understanding of U.S. nuclear negotiations, and most of the identified targets have been previously targeted by TA453.","1713":"Targeting appeared to be highly selective,\u00a0with less than ten organizations targeted, according to Proofpoint data.","1714":"Once TA453 established a time for the target to activate their invitation, the\u00a0TA453\u00a0persona\u00a0provided the personalized link to\u00a0the\u00a0intended victim.","1715":"The link led to a \u201cWebinar Control Panel\u201d on a legitimate\u00a0but compromised\u00a0website\u00a0belonging to University of London\u2019s SOAS, a research institution.","1716":"According to Proofpoint research, while TA453 does appear to have elevated privileges allowing them to create credential harvesting pages at\u00a0soasradio[.]org, other pages on the site continue to host legitimate SOAS-affiliated content.","1717":"TA453 strengthened the credibility of the attempted credential harvest by\u00a0utilizing\u00a0personas\u00a0masquerading as legitimate affiliates\u00a0of SOAS\u00a0to deliver the malicious links.","1718":"The displayed webpage (Figure\u00a02) offers users the ability to use \u201cOpenID\u201d to log in with the following mail providers; Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, iCloud, Outlook, AOL, mail.ru, Email, and Facebook.","1719":"*Figure\u00a02. SOAS displayed webpage.*","1720":"When a particular provider is clicked, a pop-up box\u00a0(Figure\u00a03)\u00a0displays the actual credential phishing box.","1721":"Of the options, Google, Microsoft, and\u00a0Email buttons prefilled the target\u2019s email address.","1722":"Based on the variety of email providers along with TA453\u2019s insistence that the target log on when TA453 was online, Proofpoint assesses that TA453 was planning on immediately validating the captured credentials manually.","1723":"Hanns\u00a0Kendel\u00a0was not the only SOAS scholar spoofed by TA453\u00a0during\u00a0Operation\u00a0SpoofedScholars.","1724":"Months later,\u00a0TA453 began spoofingTolga\u00a0Sinmazdemir, another\u00a0individual associated with\u00a0SOAS.\u00a0","1725":"Months later,\u00a0TA453 began spoofing\u00a0Tolga\u00a0Sinmazdemir, another\u00a0individual associated with\u00a0SOAS.\u00a0","1726":"These\u00a0emails\u00a0solicited contributions to a\u00a0\u201cDIPS Conference\u201d\u00a0and would have likely followed a similar kill chain\u00a0discussed above.","1727":"In mid-May,\u00a0TA453\u00a0returned, using a different\u00a0email\u00a0(hanse.kendel4[@]gmail.com)\u00a0to recruit for a webinar.","1728":"As discussed previously in Proofpoint\u2019s research on TA453\u2019s\u00a0[BadBlood](\/us\/blog\/threat-insight\/badblood-ta453-targets-us-and-israeli-medical-research-personnel-credential \"BadBlood: TA453 Targets US and Israeli Medical Research Personnel in Credential Phishing Campaigns \")\u00a0campaign, Proofpoint analysts cannot independently confirm that TA453 is part of the IRGC.\u00a0","1729":"However, the tactics and techniques used by the group and their overall targeting detected by Proofpoint is in line with IRGC intelligence collection priorities, which gives us high confidence in our assessment that\u00a0TA453 operates in\u00a0support\u00a0of\u00a0the IRGC.\u00a0The IRGC, specifically the IRGC Intelligence Organization, collects intelligence and conducts operations in support of a variety of assigned responsibilities.","1730":"According to the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center\u2019s November 2020\u00a0[report](https:\/\/www.terrorism-info.org.il\/en\/the-intelligence-organization-of-the-irgc-a-major-iranian-intelligence-apparatus\/), some of the IRGC IO\u2019s responsibilities include foiling political subversion, combating western cultural penetration, and supporting the arrest of Iranian dual nationals.","1731":"Likewise, attribution specifically for\u00a0Operation\u00a0SpoofedScholars\u00a0is based on TTP similarities to previous TA453 campaigns and consistency with TA453\u2019s historical targeting.","1732":"TA453 often uses free email providers to spoof individuals familiar to their targets to increase the likelihood of successful compromise.","1733":"Additionally, as previously discussed, TA453 concentrates their credential phishing to specific individuals of interest\u00a0to\u00a0collect\u00a0intelligence through exfiltration of sensitive email and contacts or initial access for future phishing campaigns.","1734":"For specific mitigations against Operation\u00a0SpoofedScholars, Proofpoint recommends\u00a0investigating network traffic to\u00a0soasradio[.]org,\u00a0specifically\u00a0URIs starting with\u00a0hxxps:\/\/soasradio[.]org\/connect\/?memberemailid=.","1735":"Broader mitigation efforts against TA453 campaigns include increased awareness and investigation of unusual communication from professional contacts.","1736":"Using multifactor authentication\u00a0provides another layer of protection against TA453 credential harvesting.","1737":"TA453\u00a0illegally obtained access to a website belonging to a world class academic institution\u00a0to\u00a0leverage the\u00a0compromised infrastructure to harvest the credentials of their intended targets.","1738":"The use of legitimate,\u00a0but compromised,\u00a0infrastructure represents an increase in TA453\u2019s sophistication\u00a0and will almost certainly\u00a0be reflected in future campaigns.","1739":"TA453 continues to\u00a0iterate,\u00a0innovate,\u00a0and collect\u00a0in support of IRGC collection priorities.","1740":"While\u00a0some\u00a0of the identified selectors\u00a0no longer appear to be active in TA453 operations, Proofpoint assesses with high confidence that TA453 will continue\u00a0to\u00a0spoof scholars\u00a0around the world\u00a0in support of\u00a0TA453\u2019s intelligence collection\u00a0operations\u00a0in\u00a0support of Iranian government interests.","1741":"2033317\u00a0-\u00a0ET Malware Operation\u00a0SpoofedScholars\u00a0Activity (GET)\u00a0","1742":"I Knew You

their notable evolution and continuously improving Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).","1888":"Since September 2018, we have identified multiple attacks that share similar TTPs used by Cobalt during a specific timeframe but exhibit enough differenced to attribute them to separate threat actors.","1889":"This blog post provides an overview on a specific Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) used within the e-Crime threat actor landscape.","1890":"It also provides details on two different threat actors using the MaaS that fall under the umbrella of a family we dubbed *Golden Chickens*: GC01 and GC02.","1891":"The success of Golden Chickens (GC) operations heavily relies on a specific MaaS sold in underground forums, which provides customers with the malwares and the infrastructure they need for targeted attacks.","1892":"The service owner provides the MaaS through the use of the following toolkits: Venom and Taurus building kits for crafting documents used to deliver the attack, and the more\\_eggs (aka Terra Loader, [SpicyOmelette](https:\/\/www.secureworks.com\/blog\/cybercriminals-increasingly-trying-to-ensnare-the-big-financial-fish)) backdoor for taking full control of the infected computer.","1893":"Between November 2017 and July 2018, we attributed to GC02 five spear phishing waves which indiscriminately targeted companies and organizations in at least India and the United States.","1894":"As a result of using the same MaaS provider, GC02 and Cobalt group\u2019s TTPs and infrastructure strongly overlapped in May 2018, making it hard at first glance to differentiate the two threat actors.","1895":"Between August and October 2018, we attributed to GC01 nine spear phishing waves targeting multiple companies and organizations operating in the financial industry.","1896":"Throughout the campaign, we observed the installation of multiple Remote Access Tool (RAT) variations as the result of a successfully compromised victim machine.","1897":"By highlighting the multi-layer infrastructure adopted by Cobalt and Golden Chickens, as well as the multi-client business model of the MaaS behind it, we emphasize the difficulty of performing reliable attribution for cyberattacks, and the high uncertainty that analysts are confronted with during the process.","1898":"To note, other [researchers](https:\/\/researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com\/2018\/10\/unit42-new-techniques-uncover-attribute-cobalt-gang-commodity-builders-infrastructure-revealed\/) reported the same Indicators of Compromise (IoC) and C2 infrastructure covered in this blog post.","1899":"Especially for e-Crime actors, it is a common practice to rent the same bulletproof infrastructure or botnet used by other e-Crime groups, resulting in the increased likelihood for an overlap of C2 servers.","1900":"In the last years, we have noted a tendency of threat actors outsourcing even more parts of the kill-chain to third parties by using\/offering MaaS solutions.","1901":"A threat actor can buy several malware from multiple developers, rent the C2 infrastructure from various providers, and deliver the attack vector to victims from yet another provider.","1902":"On the other hand, those providers offering MaaS solutions simplify the entire process through *One Stop Shop* solutions, where one single entity sells and rents both the malware and the infrastructure needed for an attack.","1903":"When profiling e-Crime threat actors, we always deal with the hypothesis that the malware and C2 infrastructure we are analyzing do not belong to the threat actor *per se*, but rather to the used MaaS provider.","1904":"When we confirm the use of a MaaS, the attribution process focuses on *how* and *when* threat actors used it, and *who* they targeted.","1905":"By using such an approach, we were able to differentiate past spear phishing campaigns mistakenly attributed to the Cobalt group and characterize two distinct threat actors \u2014 GC01 and GC02 \u2014 and the MaaS used by them to carry out their attacks.","1906":"Golden Chickens\u2019 MaaS","1907":"From November 2017 to October 2018, we attributed 14 campaigns to the Golden Chickens (GC) threat actors that used a specific MaaS provider (hereinafter \u201c*the Provider*\u201d) offered by a known individual (hereinafter *\u201cthe Provider Operator\u201d*).","1908":"1.Threat actors buy the service offered and then give the Provider Operator the final payload to be executed on the infected machine.","1909":"2.The Provider Operator builds the malicious document (maldoc), the backdoor, and prepares the server infrastructure needed for the execution of the attack.","1910":"Next, the backdoor is stored on a webserver and the full URL path of it is embedded into the maldoc. Lastly, the C2 panel that the backdoor will beacon to is set up.","1911":"Although not confirmed, the Provider Operator also likely delivers the access details for the backdoor\u2019s C2 web panel.","1912":"4.The threat actor disseminates (directly or through the use of a botnet) the maldoc via spear phishing.","1913":"5.Once the maldoc is executed on a victim\u2019s machine, it will retrieve and execute the backdoor from the hardcoded web location.","1914":"6.The backdoor beacons to the hardcoded C2 on a regular basis and executes the commands it receives.","1915":"7.Finally, the threat actor (or the Provider) will review the system details of the infected machine reported by the backdoor, and eventually deploy the final payload.","1916":"Those artifacts are generated by three building kits and offered to paying customers with the supporting C2 infrastructure.","1917":"**VenomKit.** VenomKit is a tool that threat actors can use to craft malicious Rich Text File (RTF) documents that exploit multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2017\u201311882, CVE-2018\u20130802, and CVE-2018\u20138174.","1918":"Successful exploitation leads to batch and scriptlet files being dropped and executed in order to download the second stage payload from a Web resource.","1919":"The AV detection rate for RTF documents generated by VenomKit is *moderate* to *high* due to the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.","1920":"**Taurus Builder Kit.** The Taurus Builder Kit generates Microsoft Word documents weaponized with malicious Visual Basic for Application (VBA) macro code.","1921":"Unlike the malicious RTFs created by VenomKit, the weaponized Word documents require user interaction in order to enable the contained malicious code.","1922":"On the other hand, documents generated by this kit are more resilient to AV detection due to the use of multiple layers of obfuscation in the VBA code.","1923":"Once the VBA code is enabled by the user, documents created by Taurus Builder Kit will download and execute additional malware by using multiple legit Windows tools in order to bypass AppLocker.","1924":"**More\\_Eggs Backdoor.** More\\_eggs is a JavaScript (JS) backdoor capable of beaconing to a fixed C2 server and executing additional payloads downloaded from an external Web resource.","1925":"The backdoor is delivered encrypted inside of another JavaScript, with changing function names, variable names, and encryption keys.","1926":"The more\\_eggs building kit allows customization of its multiple variables, for values such as the C2 server, beaconing and sleeping time, and part of the cryptographic key used for ciphering the C2 communications.","1927":"Figure 3 shows an example of more\\_eggs configuration that includes the version number *BV*, C2 address *Gate*, and part of the ciphering key used to encrypt C2 communications, *Rkey*.","1928":"For instance, more\\_eggs samples attributed to GC02 contained the extra variable *Researchers,* differently from the ones attributed to GC01 or Cobalt Group.","1929":"Although not confirmed, it is reasonable to assume that multiple more\\_eggs used by different threat actors cannot share the same *Gate* value due to the derived complication that would imply for the backend to understand which C2 communications belong to which threat actor using the infrastructure.","1930":"However, the same C2 server can host multiple gates by using different web pages; hence, multiple threat actors might use distinct gates hosted on the same domain name.","1931":"The following section highlights the operations and TTPs of three distinct threat actors that have used the Provider in the last year: the Cobalt Group, GC01 and GC02.","1932":"Figure 4 represents the multiple spear phishing campaigns we have attributed to either Cobalt[1] or the Golden Chickens (GC) family during the last year.","1933":"While all GC campaigns used the Provider, only those attributed to Cobalt in May, June, and on 2 August used the Provider.","1934":"2.**Use of the MaaS.** How the Provider was used, to what extent, and the configuration requested.","1935":"3.**Final Payload.** What final payload the MaaS delivered.","1936":"Figure 4 \u2014 Timeline analysis of attacks conducted by GC family and Cobalt Group","1937":"In May 2018, Cobalt executed three different spear phishing campaigns in between two GC02 campaigns.","1938":"The attacks leveraged the same Provider since they used maldocs generated by either VenomKit or Taurus Building Kit, more\\_eggs, and the Provider\u2019s C2 infrastructure.","1939":"Figure 4 also shows that the Cobalt group ceased to use the Provider after the campaign on 2 August, and then started to consistently use different malware and infrastructure.","1940":"Figure 5 \u2014 Cobalt and GC campaigns using the Provider","1941":"1.Delivery.Each campaign began with a spear phishing email, but each presented differences depending on the threat actor behind the attack:","1942":"* GC threat actors used either compromised or spoofed email addresses.","1943":"Furthermore, GC01 targeted companies and organizations operating in the financial industry mainly in Europe, Africa, and Asia.","1944":"Differently, GC02 indiscriminately targeted companies and organizations in at least India and the United States.","1945":"The other 12 spear phishing emails were sent from domain names previously registered by them, imitating a specific organization.","1946":"Registration of look-alike domains is a common technique used by Cobalt Group.","1947":"Lastly, all Cobalt campaigns targeted financial institutions and organizations mainly in Europe, Asia and Middle East.","1948":"2.Exploitation I (Optional).Both threat actor groups used a non-malicious PDF, luring the user to click on the contained link in order to download the maldoc.","1949":"The attackers used a technique known as [*Google Redirecto*r](https:\/\/www.securitysift.com\/why-google-makes-my-job-more-difficult\/) which consists of appending the malicious URL at the end of a Google logout URL.","1950":"By doing this, the user will first visit the legit Google logout page and then automatically be redirected to the final URL, triggering the download of the malicious document.","1951":"* Cobalt only used this technique two times, during the campaigns of 7 and 29 June.","1952":"It is not clear to us if the Provider Operator offers the non-malicious PDF (with Google Redirector technique) directly or recommends the use of a third-party kit.","1953":"3.Exploitation II \u2014 Getting the Maldoc.The user downloads either a macro-weaponized Word document created by Taurus Builder Kit, or a malicious RTF created by VenomKit.","1954":"Successful execution of the maldocs initiates the download of additional batch scripts and then the ultimate download of the more\\_eggs backdoor.","1955":"* Cobalt Group only used more\\_eggs versions 2.0, having a specific command named *via\\_x*.","1956":"This command is used to execute additional executables via cmd.exe.","1957":"For those campaigns that were not using the non-malicious PDF attack vector, the victims got the downloader through either browsing a link included in the email body, or directly through the email attachment.","1958":"4.C2 I \u2014 Getting the Backdoor.The maldoc retrieves more\\_eggs from a remote location and executes it. Next, the backdoor starts beaconing to the C2 defined in the *Gate* variable.","1959":"5.C2 II \u2014 Getting the Final Payload.Once the threat actor (or the Provider Operator) determines that the infected system is of interest, the final payload is eventually pushed and executed.","1960":"To note, we were not always able to get the final payload because the more\\_eggs C2 normally has a short lifetime.","1961":"* Campaigns attributed to GC01 resulted in the download of three different RATs: Netwire, Remcos, and Revenge.","1962":"* Campaigns attributed to Cobalt Group resulted in the download of either the CobInt backdoor, or the Cobalt Strike beacon.","1963":"So far, CobInt is a backdoor that was only observed in Cobalt Group campaigns, while Cobalt Strike is a notorious attack framework used to execute Red Team exercises.","1964":"We consider the use of CobInt and Cobalt Strike as a final payload a strong indicator while attributing attacks to the Cobalt Group.","1965":"In general, the continued adoption of threat actors leveraging MaaS plays two roles in the cyber threat landscape: (a) it enables less sophisticated actors to execute attack campaigns against high value targets, which may otherwise be out of scope due to the potentially multi-layer perimeter defenses, and; (b) it creates a cluster of technical indicators from the same infrastructure that complicates attribution efforts.","1966":"During our analysis, we identified three threat actors utilizing one particular MaaS which has operated for almost two years, proving its success and profitability.","1967":"As a result, this scenario of multiple actors using the same MaaS further corroborates why attribution of campaigns incorporating aspects of MaaS becomes more complex to distinguish due to the presumable overlap in technical indicators.","1968":"[1] To note, we only included in the timeline those campaigns attributed to Cobalt group that used the Provider or occurred near or in the same month of GC\u2019s activities.","1969":"**Email Attachments (Not-Malicious PDF with Google Redirector)**","1970":"**Google Redirector links**","1971":"### GC Maas C2

Steal Credentials","2442":"Through the intelligence gathered from the Zscaler cloud, we discovered several newly registered domains that use VoIP and voicemail as themes for their credential-stealing phishing campaigns.","2443":"In the most recent instance we saw, attackers were spoofing Cisco\u2019s Unity Connection voicemail platform.","2444":"The use of voicemail delivered in an email message, and the use of phishing pages that spoof enterprise applications, such as Office 365 and Outlook, signal the attackers\u2019 motives.","2445":"If successful in obtaining a user\u2019s credentials, attackers can access confidential data from the enterprise, potentially selling it or holding it for ransom.","2446":"The attacks are being distributed through email with an HTML attachment that contains JavaScript code which redirects the user to the credential phishing site.","2447":"Contents of the email are crafted to mimic a system-generated voicemail notification, luring the user to open the attachment to access the recorded voice message as shown in Figure 1.","2448":"*Figure 1: Email message spoofing a voicemail notification*","2449":"**HTML attachment analysis**","2450":"We observed different variants of HTML attachments used in these credential-phishing campaigns.","2451":"The email attachment is an HTML file that contains a short code snippet of JavaScript.","2452":"It uses *window.location.replace()* to redirect the user to the phishing site, as shown in Figure 2.","2453":"* All these HTML attachments have a very low detection rate on VirusTotal as shown in Figure 3 below.","2454":"Figure 3: No\u00a0detection against AV engines, as seen on VirusTotal","2455":"In the second variant, the HTML attachment contains JavaScript code that is used to decode the

Campaign Delivers Buer and Bazar Malware","2632":"Zscaler ThreatLabZ became aware of a prevalent phishing campaign targeting employees of various organizations.","2633":"During the past couple of weeks, many enterprise users have been getting spear phishing emails indicating that their employment with the company has been terminated.","2634":"These emails contain a Google document link that leads to the Bazar backdoor (from the TrickBot gang).","2635":"What's interesting is that this campaign also used the Buer loader, which is the first time we have seen these two malware strains used together.","2636":"Use of the Buer loader by the TrickBot gang comes as no surprise as this group is\u00a0known to work with different malware\u00a0groups.","2637":"In the past, the TrickBot gang\u00a0has also\u00a0worked with other botnets, such as\u00a0Emotet.","2638":"In this email campaign, instead of relying on attachments, the attackers included links to what appeared to be a legitimate Google Docs document, which itself contained links to malicious files hosted\u00a0on Google Drive or, in some cases, hosted elsewhere.","2639":"In some previous phishing email campaigns,\u00a0attackers leveraged SendGrid to distribute the initial emails to hide the Google Drive links in the documents behind a SendGrid URL as a way to bypass traditional defences.","2640":"![Spear Phishing email template 1](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/sadique\/bazar\/mail1_1.PNG)","2641":"*Figure 1: One of the spear phishing

used in both malware payloads is identical.","2650":"Most notably, the packed binaries are exe files with a randomly named export function.","2651":"The export function is responsible for payload decryption and injection.","2652":"First, a shellcode is decrypted, which further decrypts a headerless PE\u00a0loader that has the final payload in its overlay.","2653":"The headersless loader allocates memory, maps the payload into memory with proper permissions, and finally transfers control to it.","2654":"In this campaign, no process self-injection is used to load the

group\u2019s toolkit arsenal and leveraged for high-value targets.","2660":"The Bazar loader is used to download and execute the Bazar backdoor on the target system.","2661":"The goal of this backdoor is to execute binaries, scripts, modules, kill processes, and then remove itself from the compromised machine.","2662":"The samples used in this campaign heavily rely on\u00a0control flow obfuscation.","2663":"The Bazar loader downloads the Bazar backdoor from the C&C using the following URI format:","2664":"{C&C}\/api\/v\\d{3}","2665":"The downloaded payload is XOR-encrypted and can be decrypted using the script provided in the appendix.","2666":"The downloaded malware was successfully captured by the Zscaler Cloud Sandbox:","2667":"*Figure 6: The\u00a0Zscaler Cloud Sandbox

victim's machine within some period of time after the infection.","2673":"By deploying Cobalt Strike, it is clear that this stealthy backdoor is being used to gain a foothold\u00a0in corporate networks so that ransomware can be deployed, data can be stolen, or network access could be sold to other threat actors.","2674":"### Buer loader","2675":"The Buer loader was first discovered around the end of 2019.","2676":"It is a very capable malware written in C and primarily sold on Russian underground forums for around US$400.","2677":"Notably, this malware does not function in the

[report](\/blogs\/security-research\/2020-state-cloud-insecurity) on the 2020 State of Public Cloud Security that showed security misconfiguration to be the leading cause of cyberattacks against public cloud infrastructure.","2883":"In this blog, we will look at one of the commonly abused security misconfigurations\u2014the RDP service port left open to the internet\u2014and how cybercriminals abuse it.","2884":"Brute-forcing RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is the most common method used by threat actors attempting to gain access to Windows systems and execute malware.","2885":"The reason is simple: In our public cloud threat research, we have observed that 70 percent of systems keep RDP ports open in the public cloud.","2886":"Threat actors scan for these publicly open RDP ports to conduct distributed brute-force attacks.","2887":"Systems that use weak credentials are easy targets, and, once compromised, attackers\u00a0sell access to the hacked systems on the dark web to other cybercriminals.","2888":"Ransomware groups such as SamSam and Dharma have been spreading almost exclusively via RDP for years.","2889":"In this case study, we will look at Dharma ransomware attacks.","2890":"Dharma, also known as Crysis, has been distributed under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model since 2016.","2891":"Attackers use open-source port-scanning tools to scan for exposed RDP ports online and then try to gain access to a system using brute-force tools or stolen credentials purchased from the dark web.","2892":"After attackers gain access to the target system, they go on to make the system vulnerable by deleting backups, disabling antivirus software, and changing configuration settings.","2893":"Once the security is disabled and the network vulnerable, attackers deliver malware payloads.","2894":"The process involves installing ransomware, using infected machines to distribute spam, deploying keyloggers, or installing backdoors to be used for future attacks.","2895":"The below figure shows the infection cycle of Dharma ransomware delivered via RDP brute-force attack.","2896":"![Infection chain of RDP brute force attack delivers Dharma ransomware](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/sadique\/rdp_ransom\/iv1.JPG)","2897":"*Figure 1:\u00a0Infection chain of RDP brute-force attack delivers Dharma ransomware*","2898":"Once the attacker gains access to the machine, the following files are uploaded:","2899":"[ns.exe](https:\/\/www.softperfect.com\/products\/networkscanner\/) is a network enumeration and scanning tool used by attackers to scan SMB shares, open ports, and services through which they can move within the network.","2900":"[Process Hacker](https:\/\/github.com\/processhacker\/processhacker) is a program used mostly by system administrators for monitoring, debugging, and troubleshooting, but in this case, it was used for malicious purposes such as disabling AV or services.","2901":"Following the pre-execution process, the attacker uploads a ransomware file and executes it.","2902":"Once executed, this variant of Dharma ransomware uses the below commands to quietly delete all of the shadow volume copies on the machine.","2903":"For persistence, the ransomware executes the following commands:","2904":"2.Copy file to 'Startup' folder","2905":"3.Copy file to 'Common Startup\u2019 folder","2906":"The ransomware encrypts files with the following extensions:","2907":"*Figure 2:\u00a0File extensions to encrypt*","2908":"The ransomware encrypts files using an AES 256 algorithm.","2909":"The AES key is also encrypted with an RSA 1024 algorithm.","2910":"This encrypted AES key is stored at the end of the encrypted file along with the filename.","2911":"*Figure 3:\u00a0Encrypted files*","2912":"After encrypting the files, the ransomware pops up two different ransom notes on the victim\u2019s computer.","2913":"One is the *Info.hta* file, which is launched via autorun when a user logs into the computer.","2914":"### **Lateral movement**","2915":"Dharma ransomware uses typical methods for obtaining credentials and propagating laterally within a network.","2916":"In most cases, it uses the Mimikatz tool, which allows it to dump the network share credentials, and in other cases, it uses NirSoft CredentialsFileView, which allows for the recovery of passwords stored in encrypted credential files.","2917":"The obtained credentials are used to attempt lateral movement inside the on-prem as well as public cloud infrastructure.","2918":"In some cases, the ransomware tries to spread through the network by taking advantage of the compromised Domain Controller and deploying a Default Domain Policy that will run the ransomware payload on StartUp for each machine.","2919":"Since Dharma ransomware is usually installed by gaining access to Remote Desktop Services, it is important to ensure that those services are properly locked.","2920":"This includes ensuring that computers running Remote Desktop Services do not connect directly to the internet.","2921":"While applying security patches is always important, most RDP-based attacks rely on cracking weak credentials, so passwords should be long, unique, and random.","2922":"Attackers typically identify potential targets by scanning the internet for systems listening on the default RDP port (TCP 3389).","2923":"Did COVID Cancel Christmas for Cybercriminals?","2924":"ThreatLabZ, the security research team at Zscaler, is responsible for monitoring and tracking global cybercrime activity, which typically drops each year around the Russian Orthodox Christmas on January 7th.","2925":"In contrast, this year\u2019s criminal activity remained at normal levels before, during, and after the Russian Orthodox Christmas.","2926":"***![malware

Trickbot, Dridex, ZLoader, and Qakbot.","2931":"### **Emotet**","2932":"**[Update]** \u2013 On January 27, 2021, Europol announced a [global action in disrupting](https:\/\/www.europol.europa.eu\/newsroom\/news\/world%25E2%2580%2599s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action) Emotet botnet operations.","2933":"This was a collaborative effort between law enforcement authorities in the Netherlands, Germany, U.S., UK, France, Canada, Lithuania, and Ukraine, with international activity coordinated by Europol and Eurojust.","2934":"Zscaler ThreatLabZ has been closely tracking Emotet for several years (see blogs from [October 2019](\/blogs\/security-research\/emotet-back-action-after-short-break), [February 2019](\/blogs\/security-research\/demystifying-crypter-used-emotet-qbot-and-dridex), and [August 2017](\/blogs\/security-research\/look-recent-emotet-campaigns-august-2017)).","2935":"We can confirm that we haven't seen any updates or activity from the Emotet C&C infrastructure in the past 48 hours, which indicates that the takedown operation has been successful.","2936":"However, we have seen similar gangs push out new variants and resurrect the botnet using a new C&C infrastructure.","2937":"We are closely monitoring for any new Emotet variants and activity.","2938":"Emotet resumed its activity as of Monday, January 4, 2021.","2939":"To take advantage of the holiday season, Emotet briefly ramped up its activity between December 21 and 30, 2020.","2940":"During this ramped-up activity, Emotet was mostly using a *reply chain* (also known as *email thread hijacking)* spam email as the bait.","2941":"A reply chain attack is when threat actors hijack real email threads and utilize legitimate email messages stolen from victims\u2019 email applications.","2942":"This email reply is again targeted to addresses from the original email, allowing it to further gain trust from targets.","2943":"While the first batch of emails was targeting English-speaking countries, spam emails in German, Italian, French,\u00a0 Spanish, and Polish followed shortly thereafter.","2944":"An example of an Emotet reply chain spam email in Italian is shown in Figure 3.","2945":"##### ***Figure 3****: Emotet reply chain example*","2946":"The main Emotet loader had some minor changes after returning from a brief break.","2947":"Emotet continued to use spam with malicious Microsoft Word documents attached as the primary distribution method.","2948":"On January 20,2021, Emotet increased the build number to 0x13461C8 (20210120) and the loader version number to 0x1770 (6000).","2949":"Another interesting tactical move by Emotet that started in January was the shift to password-protected ZIP attachments.","2950":"Instead of including the password in the email body text, Emotet started using embedded images that contain the ZIP password.","2951":"The group has also continued to use a DLL file for the loader instead of a standard Windows executable, which may be to further evade detection.","2952":"Emotet was last seen deploying the following modules:","2953":"* Browser password stealer (based on WebPassView)","2954":"* Email password stealer (MailPassView)","2955":"* Email content stealer","2956":"* Email contact stealer","2957":"In addition, Emotet has been observed delivering Trickbot as a second-stage payload.","2958":"**Indicators -\u00a0[Emotet IOCs](https:\/\/pastebin.com\/bFAW538P)**","2959":"### **Trickbot**","2960":"Emotet started dropping Trickbot as a secondary payload on victim machines after it returned from the holiday break.","2961":"Trickbot is operated by the same threat actor that deploys Conti and Ryuk ransomware.","2962":"Therefore, these ransomware operations likely resumed around the same time as well.","2963":"Emotet was distributing Trickbot with the group tags *mor12* and *mor13*.","2964":"There have not been any significant changes in Trickbot following the holiday break.","2965":"Trickbot was also distributed by another spam campaign on the same day by the group tag *rob35*.","2966":"This specific campaign was being distributed via SpamEx, which distributed a malicious JavaScript file embedded in a ZIP file.","2967":"When opened, the JavaScript was used to invoke PowerShell to download and execute Trickbot from phishing sites.","2968":"The Trickbot campaigns with the group tags *tot6* and *lib6* have also been observed since the holiday break.","2969":"**Indicators -\u00a0[Trickbot IOCs](https:\/\/pastebin.com\/mAzUnpUQ)**","2970":"### **Dridex**","2971":"On January 11, 2021, ThreatLabZ observed the emergence of Dridex with a Cutwail spam campaign.","2972":"The group used an invoice theme to distribute the Dridex loader.","2973":"The Cutwail spam distributed payloads for Dridex sub-botnets 10444 and 10555 as Microsoft Excel attachments.","2974":"Dridex continues using DLL files for the loader instead of Windows executables, a technique that has been recently employed by the Emotet and Qakbot threat groups as well.","2975":"There was another Dridex campaign with botnet 111 observed a day later, which was using the RIG exploit kit (EK).","2976":"The same RIG EK gate was used before the Christmas holiday.","2977":"**Indicators - [Dridex IOCs](https:\/\/pastebin.com\/Mxa6Bfad)**","2978":"### **Qakbot**","2979":"On January 19, 2021, Qakbot emerged with a new spam campaign dropping a Qakbot payload with the campaign ID *abc118*.","2980":"Similar to Emotet, Qakbot is using reply chain spam email attacks.","2981":"Qakbot was also seen using a \u201ccomplaint copy\" spam theme.","2982":"Qakbot spam campaigns are distributing malicious Excel files embedded inside a ZIP attachment.","2983":"Like Emotet, Dridex, and ZLoader, Qakbot is using a DLL file for the loader instead of Windows executables.","2984":"This technique is now widely used by cybercriminals and is apparently able to evade security and sandbox solutions.","2985":"##### ***Figure 4****: Reply chain spam email distributing Qakbot*","2986":"**Indicators - [Qakbot IOCs](https:\/\/pastebin.com\/MdbbHFhg)**","2987":"### **ZLoader**","2988":"ThreatLabZ observed new ZLoader activity on January 11,\u00a02021.","2989":"The botnet then went quiet, resuming with\u00a0another spam campaign on January 19.","2990":"So far in 2021, four different ZLoader campaigns have been observed, primarily targeting US\u00a0and EU banks and financial institutions.","2991":"**Indicators - [ZLoader IOCs](https:\/\/pastebin.com\/n4JR2CeZ)**","2992":"Campaign frequency differs for\u00a0each malware family.","2993":"Some have more regular\u00a0Monday through Thursday\u00a0cycles, while others, such as Emotet and Qakbot, are unpredictable.","2994":"Usually, inactivity by cybercriminals or the absence of a malware strain is\u00a0a sign of impending changes.","2995":"Malware authors continually adapt their techniques and change their code to improve distribution, persistence, evasion,\u00a0and overall success.","2996":"ThreatLabZ\u00a0continuously monitors activity from cybercrime gangs and their evolving malware strains,\u00a0integrating all threat intelligence into the Zscaler platform so it can be distributed cloud-wide to protect all customers around the world.","2997":"Discord CDN: A Popular Choice for Hosting Malicious Payloads","2998":"During 2020, [research](https:\/\/www.analyticsinsight.net\/gaming-boom-in-covid-19-times-analysis-insights\/) showed a sharp increase in game downloads, and this activity did not go unnoticed by cybercriminals.","2999":"Attackers have often exploited the popularity of certain games ([Among Us](\/blogs\/security-research\/among-us-imposter-google-play) was a recent example) to lure players into downloading fake versions that served malware.","3000":"Recently, the Zscaler ThreatLabZ team noticed new campaigns in which cybercriminals are targeting gamers.","3001":"* Multiple campaigns relying on the cdn.discordapp.com service for their infection chain.","3002":"* Cybercriminals are using Discord CDN to host malicious files as well as for command-and-control (C&C) communication.","3003":"* Malicious files are renamed as pirated software or gaming software to trick gamers.","3004":"* File icons are also related to gaming software to trick gamers.","3005":"* Multiple categories of malware are being served through the Discord app\u2019s CDN infrastructure - ransomware, stealers, and cryptominers.","3006":"The attack usually starts with spam emails in which users are tricked with\u00a0legitimate-looking templates into downloading next-stage payloads.","3007":"It\u2019s worth noting, however, that using Discord to host payloads is not new.","3008":"This

forums as a crimeware kit to conduct credit card, identity theft, and wire fraud.","3141":"In September 2018, a new Kronos variant named [*Osiris*](https:\/\/www.proofpoint.com\/us\/threat-insight\/post\/kronos-reborn) introduced several new features including TOR for command and control (C2) communications.","3142":"The last update to Osiris appears to have been around mid-2019.","3143":"In February 2021, Zscaler ThreatLabz identified a new Kronos variant that surfaced via [spam campaigns to German speakers](https:\/\/blog.morphisec.com\/long-live-osiris-banking-trojan-targets-german-ip-addresses), which calls itself *Ares*.","3144":"Thus, the naming convention appears to refer to this new malware variant as the third generation of Kronos.","3145":"Ares still\u00a0appears to be in development alongside an information stealer that harvests credentials from various applications including\u00a0VPN clients, web browsers, and the malware\u00a0can exfiltrate arbitrary files and cryptocurrency wallets.","3146":"The threat actor behind this new variant continues to use both Osiris and Ares in parallel.","3147":"In this blog post, we will examine these new malware developments and campaigns.","3148":"DarkCrypter","3149":"Recent samples of Osiris and Ares have been protected by a malware packer written in C++ that calls itself *DarkCrypter*.","3150":"The packer contains the PDB path d:\\scm\\Italy\\dopplegang\\DarkCrypter\\Bin\\Clean.pdb.","3151":"The code is not related to the\u00a0commercial packer,\u00a0DarkCrypter, that has been [cracked and leaked online](https:\/\/github.com\/0x4xLEAKR\/DarkCrypter).","3152":"Interestingly, the packer\u00a0shares code with Kronos and Osiris including the string encryption algorithm.","3153":"When the string table is decrypted, the first 41 entries are identical to older Kronos variants with eight new string additions (shown below) to detect sandbox environments:","3154":"If the anti-analysis checks pass, the packer proceeds to the next step.","3155":"There are at least two variants of the packer.","3156":"The first variant decrypts the next-stage payload using Blowfish.","3157":"However, the Blowfish decryption implementation in DarkCrypter supports a hardcoded key size that is 288 bytes (although only the first 72 bytes are effectively used).","3158":"The second variant of the DarkCrypter packer embeds the second-stage payload in a compressed format rather than an encrypted Blowfish format.","3159":"The compression algorithm is identical to that found in Ares, and components related to\u00a0Ares, including a\u00a0packer that\u00a0impersonates a bitmap image header.","3160":"Modified UPX Packer","3161":"The threat actor has also experimented with modifying UPX headers, which has well known section names.","3162":"The modifications that have been made by the threat actor replace the UPX section names (UPX0, UPX1, ...","3163":"This breaks compatibility with the command-line UPX decompression tool, although the file can still be decompressed and executed.","3164":"Modified and Restored UPX Headers","3165":"These changes can easily be restored to the original UPX section names as shown on the right in Figure 1.","3166":"The UPX command-line utility can then be used to statically unpack this binary, producing the final executable payload.","3167":"BMPack","3168":"The threat actor has also been using another packer that Zscaler ThreatLabZ has dubbed BMPack.","3169":"This packer has been utilized to pack both Osiris and Ares payloads.","3170":"BMPack first decrypts embedded data using an XOR-based algorithm, followed by RC4.","3171":"After the decryption stage, the file appears to be a bitmap image as shown in Figure 2.","3172":"Fake Bitmap Image Used to Unpack\u00a0Osiris and Ares Malware\u00a0Payloads","3173":"However, a closer inspection reveals that the data is not actually a bitmap image, but has a specific sequence of data structures.","3174":"Format of BMPack Data Structures","3175":"Each decompressed structure holds a different section of a PE file that is reconstructed and stitched together by a custom loader, and executed.","3176":"Ares Malware","3177":"Ares is being actively developed and the malware author continues to create and test new plugins and web injects.","3178":"In the most recent Ares samples, there is an embedded DLL module that is compressed within the binary.","3179":"The module contains an export that is designed to establish persistence.","3180":"The code first copies itself to the location %APPDATA%\\Adobe\\AdobeNotificationUpdates.exe.","3181":"It then creates a scheduled task named *AdobeNotificationUpdates* that is designed to execute Ares every two hours (with an expiration date of 2050-05-02 12:05:00).","3182":"Similar persistence code is also found in many DarkCrypter samples.","3183":"The Ares persistence module has the same compilation prefix as other modules in its PDB path D:\\scm\\Italy\\ares\\source\\_ob\\Release\\startup.pdb.","3184":"Ares attempts to locate an export name with the hash value F4S4G3S4U7C6P2P7, which maps to the string\u00a0[[email\u00a0protected]](\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection)@[[email\u00a0protected]](\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection).","3185":"Once the address of this function is located, Ares executes the module.","3186":"Ares uses the same function hashing algorithm as Kronos, which consists of calculating a CRC64 hash, converting the digest to uppercase hexadecimal characters.","3187":"The result is then mapped to an alphanumeric value as shown in the Python code below:","3188":"Ares contains most of the same code as its predecessors:\u00a0Kronos and Osiris.","3189":"However, there are several notable differences between Osiris and Ares, especially with respect to the C2 communications.","3190":"Most Ares samples currently do not communicate with C2 servers over TOR.","3191":"It is not quite clear, why most Ares samples have the TOR component removed, but it may be to reduce\u00a0the malware's file size and evade corporate firewalls that block TOR network traffic.","3192":"However, without TOR, the C2 servers are more vulnerable to takedown attempts.","3193":"Some Ares samples attempt to address this limitation by hardcoding a large number of C2 URLs in the binary.","3194":"Zscaler ThreatLabz has observed one Ares sample with [101 hardcoded C2 URLs](https:\/\/pastebin.com\/XU6YfvWG).","3195":"Ares has also slightly modified the bot ID generation code, replacing the string Kronos with the string Ares as shown in Figure 4.","3196":"Comparison Between Kronos and Ares Bot ID Generation\u00a0","3197":"Ares uses the HTTP query string parameters shown in Table 1.","3198":"The HTTP request that sends the report.zip file is unique to Ares and\u00a0discussed in more detail below.","3199":"| a=0 | Send log data |","3200":"| a=1 | Download web injects |","3201":"| a=2 | Send keylogger data |","3202":"| a=3 | Send\u00a0report.zip file created by Ares Stealer |","3203":"| a=4 | Request new commands |","3204":"Ares Query String Parameters","3205":"### Ares Commands","3206":"Ares supports many of the same commands as Kronos and Osiris.","3207":"However, some of the commands have been modified and the malware uninstall command (0x1) was removed.","3208":"There are four modified commands that are supported by Ares as shown below in Table 2.","3209":"| 0x3 | Set registry value name MSE to 0 |","3210":"| 0x4 | Set registry value name MSE to 1 |","3211":"| 0x6 | Download, decompress, map Ares Stealer into memory, and execute |","3212":"| 0xC | Download, decompress, map module into memory, and execute |","3213":"New Commands Introduced By Ares","3214":"The commands 0x3\u00a0and 0x4\u00a0attempt to set a registry value name *MSE* to zero and one, respectively, under the registry key HKEY\\_CURRENT\\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\CurrentVersion.","3215":"This is likely an oversight by the malware author who accidentally left out\u00a0*Windows*\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0registry path between *Microsoft* and *CurrentVersion*.","3216":"The registry value is not referenced elsewhere in Ares, so it may hint at a future use.","3217":"One of the most significant modifications is the command 0x6 that downloads, decompresses, and maps a PE file into memory, and executes it.","3218":"The first string is a pattern provided by the C2 server and the second is hardcoded to the string %APPDATA%\\Google\\report.zip.","3219":"Zscaler ThreatLabZ has observed this Ares command being used to download a file from the URL http:\/\/mydynamite.dynv6[.]net\/panel\/upload\/stealer.dll.","3220":"The file is decompressed using the same compression algorithm as BMPack.","3221":"Ares has code artifacts from the development of command 0x6.","3222":"The file is decompressed and mapped into memory using the same process as command 0x6.","3223":"After the file is mapped, the export CollectInfo is called with the parameters: %userprofile%Documents|*.txt|5 and NULL.","3224":"Zscaler ThreatLabZ has also identified Ares samples that contain\u00a0another unreferenced function that\u00a0loads a\u00a0VNC plugin by attempting to open a file located at d:\\scm\\Italy\\ares\\\\source\\_ob\\Binaries\\Release\\vnc.dll.cmp.","3225":"Similar to the stealer plugin, the file is decompressed, mapped into memory, and the export MakeItStart is called.","3226":"The MakeItStart export name is resolved similar to the other Ares functions using the same CRC64-based hash algorithm and comparing the result with F0U5R4R6Q8H1P3E5.","3227":"Ares then will terminate the VNC plugin by mapping the export name MakeItStop using the same process and comparing the result with the hash value C6P3T6Q8H1P3E5A8.","3228":"The command 0xC is the most recent modification to Ares and only found in newer samples.","3229":"Ares Stealer","3230":"Ares Stealer is downloaded by Ares\u00a0and invoked via the export name CollectInfo.","3231":"The malware is written in C++ and uses the Boost and Curl libraries.","3232":"Ares Stealer has compilation artifacts showing that the Boost library was compiled in the directory d:\\scm\\Italy\\tools\\boost\\_1\\_74\\_0\\boost.","3233":"This directory prefix is identical to the DarkCrypter\u2019s PDB path and the location where the Ares unreferenced\u00a0test functions attempt to load plugins from.","3234":"This artifact along with the shared compression code suggests that the malware author likely has developed DarkCrypter, BMPack, Ares, and Ares Stealer.","3235":"The Ares Stealer export CollectInfo takes two parameters: a pipe-delimited string and a filename string.","3236":"The pipe-delimited string takes three arguments, which are used by the stealer\u2019s file grabber feature.","3237":"The first parameter is the directory in which to start the file enumeration process, the second parameter is a search pattern, and the last parameter is the directory search depth.","3238":"An example command string observed from an Ares C2 server is %userprofile%|pass*.txt|5.","3239":"This command will search a victim\u2019s user profile directory up to five levels deep for text files that have the prefix pass.","3240":"Ares Stealer collects detailed system information and harvests credentials for numerous applications including FTP clients, VPN clients, web browsers, instant messengers, and email clients.","3241":"It can also steal files, cryptocurrency wallets, cookies, and credit cards.","3242":"The stealer will attempt to extract information from the following applications:","3243":"* Mozilla Firefox","3244":"* Google Chrome","3245":"* Microsoft Edge","3246":"* Microsoft Internet Explorer","3247":"* Yandex Browser","3248":"* Electrum","3249":"* Bitcoin","3250":"Osiris","3251":"The Osiris version that has been used by this threat actor contains a number of new features since the original version that appeared in April 2018.","3252":"* New beacon request format that includes information about the compromised system","3253":"* Zlib compression to reduce the size of requests and responses (including web injects)","3254":"* Ability to deploy TeamViewer on a compromised host","3255":"* Ability to steal a victim\u2019s Outlook contacts via [Nirsoft\u2019s

server that is located at http:\/\/ylnfkeznzg7o4xjf[.]onion\/kpanel\/connect.php, which has been instructing infected systems to steal and exfiltrate web browser and email credentials.","3258":"The web browser harvesting command\u00a0downloads a sqlite3 library from http:\/\/qqkzfkax24p4elax[.]onion\/kpanel\/upload\/sqlite3.dll, which is a dependency to extract Google Chrome passwords.","3259":"A second module for harvesting Firefox credentials from a 64-bit system is downloaded from http:\/\/qqkzfkax24p4elax[.]onion\/kpanel\/upload\/ffc64.exe.","3260":"The C2 is also serving a web inject configuration file, which targets clients at\u00a0German financial institutions with the URL patterns shown below:","3261":"When a victim browses to a website that matches one of these patterns, JavaScript code will be injected from the threat actor\u2019s domain https:\/\/securebankingapp[.]com\/.","3262":"The full list of web injects for this Osiris instance is shown [here](https:\/\/pastebin.com\/tTxmjA1K).","3263":"The threat actor has another active Osiris C2 server located at http:\/\/qqkzfkax24p4elax[.]onion\/kpanel\/connect.php.","3264":"This C2 server is also serving commands to exfiltrate credentials, but the web inject configuration file is blank.","3265":"However, the C2 server is also providing commands to extract a victim\u2019s email contact list using Nirsoft\u2019s OutlookAddressBookView, which is downloaded from the following locations:","3266":"Ares is a new fork of the Kronos banking trojan that appears to be in the early stages of development.","3267":"The threat actor has invested significant resources in building DarkCrypter, BMPack, Ares, and Ares Stealer.","3268":"Therefore, activity related to this threat is likely to

online forums that are common hangouts for neophyte to mid-level cyber criminals.","3316":"We speculate that the malware author is running widespread campaigns involving different commodity and custom malware to steal information to sell in underground marketplaces.","3317":"Similar to other attacks outlined in the recent [ThreatLabZ State of Encrypted Attacks report](\/blogs\/security-research\/2020-state-encrypted-attacks), this campaign serves as yet another example of the importance of continuous SSL inspection and [zero

Application Layer Protocols for communication between malware and command and control (C&C) servers.","3479":"This is for several reasons: first, malicious traffic blends in more easily with legitimate traffic on standard protocols like HTTP\/S; second, companies that rely on appliances for security often don\u2019t inspect all SSL\/TLS encrypted traffic as it is extremely resource-intensive to do so.","3480":"However, the massive growth of SSL attacks \u2013\u00a0[260% higher in 2020 compared to 2019](\/blogs\/security-research\/2020-state-encrypted-attacks)\u00a0\u2013 has turned many security teams\u2019 attention to these encrypted channels.","3481":"For those that do inspect their encrypted traffic, modern network security proxies, gateways, and firewalls are evolved enough to conveniently parse application protocols and strip the SSL layer to scan the underlying data.","3482":"These trends have led some adversaries to turn to custom protocols.","3483":"Although custom protocols for malicious communication are nothing new,\u00a0almost one-third of prevalent malware families we recently analyzed support communication over non-HTTP\/S protocols.","3484":"Almost all of these malware families are Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and are found all over, from

text.*","3504":"However, in most cases, the communication is encrypted using the RC4 algorithm with a key present in the configuration.","3505":"It is not possible to match signatures in encrypted binary data.","3506":"Upon execution, Remcos sends system information to its C&C server, and in return the server replies with commands to execute.","3507":"As this request and response is encrypted

password stealing, and many more.","3535":"Quasar encrypts communications using an AES algorithm with a pre-shared key hardcoded in the client binary.","3536":"However, the distinctive characteristics of encrypted data packets can be leveraged to flag Quasar's AES encrypted traffic.","3537":"*Fig.10: Data sent to C&C server as AES encrypted.*","3538":"The distinctive first 4 bytes of the payload

prevalent.","3543":"Over the last couple of years, there have been huge ongoing phishing campaigns delivering Agent Tesla RAT.","3544":"Agent Tesla has evolved over time, varying its behavior from campaign to campaign.","3545":"Cybercriminals use this RAT to steal user credentials and spy on victims through screenshots, keyboard logging, and clipboard capturing.","3546":"Credential stealing is supported across various software ranging from browsers to mail clients, VPNs, and wallets.","3547":"Agent Tesla communicates and exfiltrates data to its C&C server on HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and Telegram API.","3548":"All collected data is encapsulated into an HTML page, and that HTML page is sent to a C&C over one of the aforementioned protocols.","3549":"For communication over FTP, the HTML page is sent as a file to an FTP C&C server.","3550":"*Fig.11: Data to be sent via FTP.*","3551":"*Fig.12: Exfiltration over FTP*","3552":"For communication over SMTP, the HTML page is sent as a mail body to

machine as well as download and execute additional malware.","3556":"It also has a wide range of information-stealing abilities including browser credential theft, keylogging, screen capture, and remote enabling of webcams.","3557":"The CyberGate RAT communicates on a custom protocol over TCP.","3558":"CyberGate\u00a0collects the info as per the command received from the C&C server, compresses data by ZLib, encrypts it by RC4 with a hardcoded key, and then sends it to the C&C server.","3559":"*Fig.14: Compressed and Encrypted data sent to C&C.*","3560":"To flag the CyberGate RAT traffic, a combination of data length, marker, and delimiter can be considered.","3561":"### **NanoCore RAT**","3562":"Though NanoCore RAT emerged almost a decade ago, it is still one of the most prevalent RAT families, and multiple versions have appeared since then.","3563":"NanoCore RAT is modular malware which comes with plugin support to expand its functionality.","3564":"Basic plugins feature remote surveillance via remote desktop, monitor webcam, capture audio, etc.","3565":"Additional plugins have been found to be used for cryptocurrency mining, ransomware attacks, credential stealing, and more.","3566":"NanoCore RAT has been found to be delivered via phishing emails containing .doc macros that load a NanoCore binary with fileless infection techniques.","3567":"NanoCore communicates on a custom protocol over TCP and uses the DES algorithm with hardcoded key and IV value to encrypt the communication between bot and its C&C server.","3568":"The communication packet begins with a 4-byte data length followed by DES-encrypted data of that length.","3569":"Fig.15: Encrypted data C&C communication","3570":"It is not possible to scan for patterns in DES-encrypted data.","3571":"This results in some encrypted traffic that will be the same across all bots generated using the publicly available bot-builder.","3572":"For a more generic detection, we need to check for heuristics of data length value against TCP packet size and entropy of data.","3573":"Fig.16: Fix length first response from C&C server.","3574":"### **Gh0st RAT**","3575":"Gh0st is an open-source

Zscaler ThreatLabZ\u00a0research team has been tracking these skimmer groups and monitoring the techniques they're using.","3611":"The latest techniques include compromising vulnerable versions of e-commerce platforms, hosting skimmer scripts on CDNs and\u00a0cloud services, and using newly registered domains (NRDs) lexically close to any legitimate web service or specific e-commerce store to host malicious skimmer scripts.","3612":"In this blog, we will provide an overview of the recent trends we are seeing in JavaScript skimmer attacks.","3613":"Skimming is a technique by\u00a0which cybercriminals steal credit card information from e-commerce sites and other internet payment portals.","3614":"Threat actors exploit software vulnerabilities to gain\u00a0access to a website's source code.","3615":"Once they have access, they\u00a0inject malicious JavaScript that allows them to exfiltrate data.","3616":"Historically, the Magento platform has been the most highly targeted in skimmer attacks.","3617":"**Newly registered domains (NRDs) in skimmer attacks**","3618":"The use of NRDs in skimmer attacks for hosting malicious scripts\u00a0exfiltrating skimmed data\u00a0provides an advantage to attackers since each NRD's lack of reputation makes\u00a0it easy to evade\u00a0reputation-based engines.","3619":"In most attacks, newly registered domains are typosquatting for legitimate web services, such as Google ads, CDNs, Jquery, Magento, etc., as typosquatting increases the chance of remaining undetected in legitimate traffic.","3620":"Recently, threat actors have most frequently utilized domains lexically close to Google and Google services, followed by domains lexically close to Jquery\/ JavaScript and web analytics.","3621":"![Trend for newly registered

legitimate communication and analytics services, such as\u00a0Telegram and Google analytics, for data exfiltration.","3626":"Some of these skimmer techniques can be defeated by configuring Content Security Policy (CSP).","3627":"CSP\u00a0is an added layer of web security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.","3628":"These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement to distribution of malware.","3629":"By configuring CSP, web admins can specify domains that should be considered valid sources for scripts\u2014though such specifications can often be bypassed by attackers abusing the Google Analytics API, which is used legitimately by a large number of websites.","3630":"ThreatLabZ\u00a0observed a significant spike during February and March 2021 in such attacks, where legitimate communication and analytics services are abused, but they have trailed off in recent weeks.","3631":"![Hits of skimmer groups abusing legitimate services over 90

CDNs.","3635":"Below are two examples of recent skimmer attacks using NRDs and CDNs to serve\u00a0content to specific websites.","3636":"**Case 1:** In one of the skimmer attacks, we observed two NRDs involved\u2014one for injecting malicious skimmer code and the other for data exfiltration.","3637":"These domains are lexically similar to the keywords *jquery* and *CDN*\u00a0to help attacks remain
