","279":"In this report, we analyze another previously undisclosed backdoor associated with this cluster of activity which shares with it not only a common infrastructure but also the same high-level intelligence-gathering goal. ","280":"Key findings: A previously unknown Go-based backdoor called TinyNote was found on one of the Camaro Dragon distribution servers, in addition to being spotted in the wild.","281":"The malware samples also communicate with other known C&C servers attributed to Camaro Dragon. ","282":"The TinyNote backdoor is distributed with names related to foreign affairs matters, and likely targets Southeast and East Asian embassies. ","283":"The backdoor performs a bypass of the Indonesian antivirus SmadAV, a security tool popular in Southeast Asian countries, such as Myanmar and Indonesia, and apparently used by a subset of the campaign targets. ","284":"The TinyNote backdoor is a first-stage malware only capable of basic machine enumeration and command execution via PowerShell or Goroutines.","285":"However, it focuses on redundancy to gain a foothold on the infected machine, including setting up multiple persistency tasks, communication with several different C&C servers, and different types of C&C command execution. ","286":"Introduction When we investigated a few delivery servers related to Camaro Dragon, we discovered that one of them exposed the threat actors\u2019 tools and files located on the server, only protected by basic HTTP Authorization with a known password.","287":"Among many other tools, previously discussed by other researchers, we discovered yet another backdoor that we named TinyNote.","288":"Interestingly, the folder with the backdoor contained two other tools: Autoruns by Sysinternals, and HRSWord, which is a part of the Chinese Huorong Network Technology protection suite, and is often used by various actors to disable endpoint protection tools. ","289":"The backdoor we found on the server, and its versions found in the wild, are executables with names related to foreign affairs, such as PDF_ Contacts List Of Invitated Deplomatic Members and Note_Documents_No.14-Tokyo-__From___Embassy___of___Russia_.","290":"This naming convention is similar to the one used at the same time by the MQsTTang backdoor versions discovered by ESET and found in VT.","291":"Similar to MQsTTang, the TinyNote backdoor samples also contain folder icon in an attempt to deceive victims about their real purpose. ","292":"The custom backdoor is written in the Go programming language.","293":"In the copyright and build information for the executables, the malware developers left a reference to code.mil.mm, the Myanmar military infrastructure, likely to add credibility to their tool.","294":"The actors\u2019 heightened interest in Myanmar entities and successful attacks carried out against them were previously discussed thoroughly.","295":"Our examination of the infrastructure led us to other findings that indicate the actors\u2019 interest in Taiwan\u2019s government entities as well. ","296":"The TinyNote backdoor is a basic remote shell, limited in capabilities: it enables the actors to fingerprint the infected machine, set up persistence, and establish two different ways to execute commands received from the C&C server.","297":"Despite its simplicity, it employs an interesting method of bypassing a very specific antivirus solution, suggesting the actors had issues gaining a foothold in specific environments. ","298":"SmadAV evasion At the beginning of its execution, the malware starts a function called bypassSMADAV, whose purpose is to bypass the Indonesian antivirus Smadav.","299":"The developers of the antivirus position their solution as a \u201csecond-layer antivirus\u201d with \u201cactive users mostly from Indonesia, and other users mostly come from Southeast Asia and Africa Countries\u201d.","300":"The existence of the code that handles this specific antivirus once again confirms the focused targeting of Camaro Dragon campaigns and their knowledge of their victims\u2019 environments and solutions.","301":"It\u2019s worth mentioning that in previous operations, the actors used SmadAV for their own purposes, forcing its component SmadAVprotect32.exe to side-load their malicious DLL. ","302":"When any new process starts in the system, SmadAV scans all available windows.","303":"For every problematic window found, the antivirus checks if the window is visible with the API function IsWindowVisible.","304":"If the window is visible, it adds this window owner\u2019s process ID to an array containing all current processes that have at least one visible window: Figure 1 \u2013 SmadAV code that collects a list of PIDs that have associated windows. ","305":"After iterating over all windows, the antivirus process iterates over this array and compares each process ID to the newly created process ID.","306":"If none is found, meaning the new process doesn\u2019t have any visible windows, the antivirus deems the newly created process to be malicious and shows a popup that suggests blocking the created process.","307":"This flow might act as protection from the techniques like process hollowing where the process is created in suspend mode and then replaced with malicious code. ","308":"The threat actors appear to have reverse-engineered the logic of smadAV and dealt with this check by creating a window without a window name, but with the class name \u201cEDIT\u201d which is one of the available default windows class names.","309":"The window attributes include a very large number for the X position, the width and height are set to 0, and flags such as WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW define the window as a tool window.","310":"These attributes make sure the window is identified as visible by IsWindowVisible function, but in fact, it is not shown to the user and does not appear in the taskbar or when pressing ALT+TAB: ","311":"Figure 2 \u2013 A piece of malware code creates a specially crafted window to bypass the smadAV. ","312":"Before a call to CreateWindowEx, you would usually first need to create a class by calling RegisterClass and then class CreateWindowEx.","313":"But in this case, the threat actors decided to use a default class name which allows them to skip calling the RegisterClass function prior to calling CreateWindow.","314":"Ultimately, creating this window allows the threat actors to bypass the check, as the newly created window is technically visible, and continue the backdoor execution uninterrupted. ","315":"Figure 3 \u2013 SmadAV detection on the Go backdoor with the removed bypassSMADAV function.

","428":"The procedure involves utilizing the instruction itself, and it goes as follows: ","429":"The ransomware finds the relevant syscall numbers for NT APIs, mainly related to file manipulation. ","430":"Rorschach then stores the numbers in a table for future use. ","431":"When needed, it calls a stub routine that uses the number directly with the syscall instruction instead of using the NT API. ","432":"In other words, the malware first creates a syscall table for NT APIs used for file encryption: Figure 3 \u2013 Creation of syscall table for certain NT APIs.

","510":"While Data Execution Prevention (DEP) has been engineered to block plain code injection attacks from specific memory areas, attackers have quickly adapted and instead of injecting an entire code payload, they resorted in reusing multiple code chunks from DEP-allowed memory pages, called ROP gadgets.","511":"These code chunks are taken from already existing code in the target application and chained together to resemble the desired attacker payload or to just disable DEP on a per page basis to allow the existing code payloads to run. ","512":"To permanently block ROP attacks, a new hardware-enforced Control Flow Integrity mitigation called Control Enforcement Technology (CET) has been developed by Intel and first shipped on Windows systems roughly two years ago. ","513":"At first, the advent of CET painted a bleak picture future for exploit developers and their reliance on ROP-based techniques.","514":"However, in 2015, a new code-reuse technique named Counterfeit Object-Oriented Programming (COOP) has been formulated in a paper which seemed quite promising in defeating Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) defenses. ","515":"In this blog, we\u2019ll briefly cover how CFI mitigations works, including CET, and how we can leverage COOP to effectively bypass Intel CET on the latest Windows releases. ","516":"Forward-Edge and Backward-Edge CFI Control Flow Integrity mechanisms can be grouped into two main categories: forward-edge and backward-edge. ","517":"Forward-edge CFI, like Microsoft CFG, protects indirect function calls through the use of verified function addresses.","518":"For instance, if we overwrite the pointer dereferenced in a CALL [rax] instruction with a ROP gadget address, CFG will block our exploit by throwing an exception. ","519":"Conversely, backward-edge CFI like Intel\u2019s CET protects a function\u2019s return address by comparing it to a previously saved version of the address that is stored on the Shadow Stack.","520":"If the original return address gets overwritten during a memory corruption exploit, the address comparison will inevitably fail and the application will be terminated.","521":"Given that ROP-based attacks execute \u201cRET\u201d instructions without a prior \u201cCALL\u201d instruction, the running thread\u2019s stack and the shadow stack values mismatch and so backward-edge CFI like CET effectively blocks this attack technique. ","522":"Intel CET has been designed to mitigate ROP attacks through both the Shadow Stack and COP\/JOP via Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT).","523":"However since the latter technology has not yet been implemented on Windows, in this blog post we are going to refer to \u201cIntel CET\u201d as the implementation with only Shadow Stack enabled. ","524":"CET internals have been documented extensively in previous researches [6][7] and we have already demonstrated how the mitigation works and on which major software CET has been deployed.","525":"At the time of this writing the landscape hasn\u2019t changed much and every major browser continues to run CET on every process except the renderer process.","526":"This means that the way CET is currently implemented is quite ineffective because the renderer process is the one that gets typically exploited. ","527":"Even though CET is still not widely enforced on browsers we should expect it to be enforced on every process over the coming years.","528":"To avoid getting caught unprepared, as researchers, we should improve our tradecraft and constantly learn about newly developed attack angles.","529":"Additionally, no matter how impeding a mitigation might be, we need to broaden our horizon if we want to find any weaknesses. ","530":"Counterfeiting Objects As mentioned in this post\u2019s premise, a novel code reuse technique named Counterfeit Object-Oriented Programming or COOP has been put together by Felix Schuster in 2015.","531":"We should note that this paper is quite theoretical.","532":"The technique has not been observed implemented in the wild or in disclosed exploits.","533":"Our goal for this blog post is to try to leverage this theoretical approach and implement it in a proof of concept in order to bypass Intel CET. ","534":"The main idea behind this technique is counterfeiting \u2013 that is crafting new objects in-memory from attacker-controlled payloads and to chain them together through virtual functions that are already present in the target application or in loaded libraries. ","535":"Each virtual function contained in a counterfeit object is called a vfgadget and is responsible for performing a small task.","536":"Similarly to ROP, vfgadgets can perform tasks like populating a value into a register.","537":"However when grouped together, multiple vfgadgets can execute more advanced operations. ","538":"As no specific tools exist today to discover vfgadgets, they can be found through custom scripts such as IDAPython, using a process similar to ROP gadget discovery. ","539":"Since vfgadgets are picked from a pool of CFG-valid functions we can mark them as legitimate, and their execution will not be blocked by CFG once we hijack an indirect call with one of them. ","540":"In addition, an interesting corollary is that Intel CET won\u2019t be triggered since we won\u2019t corrupt any function return address during the process of calling vfgadgets in sequence. ","541":"As illustrated in Schuster\u2019s paper, a typical COOP payload begins with a foundational vfgadget that acts as the COOP\u2019s main function.","542":"We\u2019ll refer to it as Looper in this blog post.","543":"Once the attacker has assembled the counterfeit object in memory, the Looper vfgadget iterates over an array of other vfgadgets, carefully prearranged by the attacker, which will be invoked one by one.","544":"By aligning the vfgadgets in the counterfeit object in such a way, we\u2019ll be able to call valid virtual functions in a controlled manner. ","545":"Once the Looper is running, it can then call other vfgadgets that are responsible for executing specific operations, like Argument LoadersInvokers and Collectors.","546":"These vfgadgets will be stored at regular intervals within the the array accessed by the Looper. ","547":"An Argument Loader vfgadget populates a given register by loading a value into it.","548":"The value to be loaded will be stored inside the counterfeit object at an offset from the beginning of the fake object. ","549":"Once the registers are populated by one or more Argument Loaders, an Invoker vfgadget can be called to simply execute the function pointer of the target API. ","550":"Collectors are gadgets that retrieve a value already present in a register, and save it back into the attacker\u2019s counterfeit object (i.e. as a returned value from an invoked API). ","551":"The following graph sum-up the COOP attack strategy discussed so far. ","552":"COOP attack flow We can arrange and mix different vfgadgets based on their availability and the desired APIs that we want to execute. ","553":"In order to better understand a COOP attack, let\u2019s start by analyzing the main vfgadget, the Looper.","554":"The following assembly code provides a simplified version of a Looper COOP vfgadget: mov rbx, [rcx+0x40] loop_start: mov rax, [rbx] call cs:__guard_dispatch_icall_fptr mov rbx, [rbx+20h] test rbx, rbx jnz short loop_start ... ","555":"loop_exit: ret Looper Gadget relevant ASM code On the first line, RCX holds the this pointer and we load into RBX the start of the counterfeit object that has been placed at offset 0x40 from RCX.","556":"Since all the items in our counterfeit objects will be referenced at offsets from thethis pointer, we need to make sure to save its value before hijacking the program flow (i.e by corrupting a vtable). ","557":"The COOP payload base address is then dereferenced into RAX which points to the first vfgadget that gets called.","558":"Once the call returns, a new vfgadget is loaded at offset 0x20 from the previous gadget and if the content of RBX is not zero, a new iteration of the loop takes place. ","559":"While writing our counterfeit object in memory, we need to align upfront each vfgadget to match the Looper offsets, similarly to the following layout: ","560":"The COOP buffer in memory Here, 00000227`26cd8900 is the base address of our COOP payload, which is stored at offset 0x40 from the this pointer (RCX).","561":"From the previous code listing, we notice at the first line of the _loopstart routine that the pointer gets dereferenced into RAX, which in turn points to the first vfgadget.","562":"On the next loop iteration the Looper repeats the same task by loading a pointer at offset 0x20 from the previous one and ultimately invokes the second vfgadget. ","563":"When exploiting real-world targets such browsers, it is recommended to rely on the Looper vfgadget because it gives more control and stability over the other vfgadgets.","564":"However, for the sake of brevity, we wrote our vulnerable application with only a single Invoker vfgadget which accepts one argument, as we\u2019ll see in the next section. ","565":"Having covered introductory COOP theory, let\u2019s move on to exploiting a CET-compiled proof of concept application that we developed to showcase COOP attacks.

","656":"We have observed similar traits in previous cases where Emotet and Quantum were seen. ","657":"Case Summary The intrusion began when a user double clicked a LNK file, which then executed encoded Powershell commands to download an Emotet DLL onto the computer.","658":"Once executed, Emotet setup a Registry Run Key to maintain persistence on the beachhead host. ","659":"Emotet, then proceeded to execute a short list of discover commands using the Windows utilities systeminfo, ipconfig, and nltest targeting the network\u2019s domain controllers.","660":"These commands would go on to be repeated daily by the Emotet process.","661":"Around one and one-half hours after execution, Emotet began sending spam emails, mailing new malicious attachments to continue spreading. ","662":"Similar activity continued over the second day, but on the third day of the incident, Emotet dropped a Cobalt Strike executable beacon onto the beachhead host.","663":"Using the Cobalt Strike beacon, the threat actors began conducting a new round of discovery activity.","664":"Windows net commands were run, targeting domain groups and computers, nltest was executed again, and they also used tasklist and ping to investigate a remote host. ","665":"The threat actor then moved laterally to a workstation.","666":"They first attempted this action using a PowerShell beacon and a remote service on the host, but while the script did execute on the remote host, it appeared to fail to connect to the command and control server.","667":"Next, they proceeded to transfer a beacon executable over SMB to the remote host\u2019s ProgramData directory.","668":"This beacon was then successfully executed via WMI and connected successfully to the threat actors server. ","669":"Once on this new host the threat actors proceeded to run the net commands to review the Domain Administrators group again.","670":"They then proceeded to dump credentials from the LSASS process on the host.","671":"With some further process injection they then began to enumerate SMB shares across the environment and on finding a primary file server reviewed several documents present on the server.","672":"This Cobalt Strike server stopped communicating shortly there after. ","673":"On the fourth day of the intrusion, Emotet dropped a new Cobalt Strike beacon.","674":"Again, some net command discovery was run for domain admins and domain controller servers.","675":"A flight of netlogon authentications were observed from the beachhead host to the domain controller as a possible attempt at exploiting the domain controller. ","676":"The threat actors, however, proceeded along a more traditional path, using SMB file transfers and remote services to move laterally across domain controllers and several other servers in the environment using Cobalt Strike beacon DLL\u2019s.","677":"On the domain controller, the threat actors conducted further discovery tasks running find.bat and p.bat, which executed AdFind active directory discovery and performed a ping sweep across the environment. ","678":"On one of the other targeted servers, the threat actors deployed Tactical RMM, a remote management agent, for additional access and persistence in the environment.","679":"From this server, the threat actors were observed using Rclone to exfiltrate data from a file share server in the environment.","680":"The Mega.io service was the location the stolen data was sent. ","681":"On the fifth day of the intrusion, the threat actors appeared again to try and exfiltrate some data from the mail server again using Rclone but this appeared to fail and the threat actors did not try to resolve the issue.","682":"After this the threat actors went silent until the eighth and final day of the intrusion. ","683":"On the eighth day of the intrusion the threat actor accessed the environment using Tactical RMM to deploy Anydesk on the compromised host.","684":"After establishing a connection using Anydesk, the threat actors then dropped SoftPerfect\u2019s Network Scanner and ran it to identify hosts across the environment. ","685":"From there, the threat actors began connecting to other hosts via RDP, including the a backup server.","686":"After choosing a new server and connecting via RDP, the threat actors dropped Powertool64.exe and dontsleep.exe in preparation for their final actions.","687":"Finally, locker.dll and a batch file 1.bat were dropped on the host and the batch file was executed beginning the Quantum rasomware deployment to all hosts over SMB.","688":"From initial intrusion to ransomware deployment, 154 hours passed, over eight days. ","689":"After ransomware deployment, the threat actors remained connected and did RDP to a few other servers and executed ProcessHacker.exe and a net command.","690":"With no other activity taking place, we assess that this was likely the threat actors confirming successful deployment of the ransomware payload across the network. ","691":"Services We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, BumbleBee, Covenant, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc.","692":"More information on this service and others can be found here.

","926":"This specific phishing campaign is noteworthy because it abuses two cloud services throughout the attack: TrustedForm, a digital certificate service provided by ActiveProspectis, is abused to track victims and collect information about them, and the PAAY 3DS, a cloud-based platform that authenticates payment transactions, is abused to validate the credit card details collected from the victims. ","927":"Cybersecurity awareness training, specifically educating users to be wary of fake shipment notifications, is an effective defense against these types of phishing attacks.","928":"Netskope customers also receive protection from the threats discussed in this blog through the Next Generation Secure Web Gateway (SWG). ","929":"First Stage \u2013 Deception ","930":"The attack starts when the victim receives an email or a text message that uses a common social engineering technique, creating a false sense of urgency to get the victim\u2019s attention. ","931":"The specific approach here, using a fake shipping notification, is also a common technique used by scammers. ","932":"First steps of this FedEx phishing campaign. ","933":"Step 1 \u2013 Once the victim reaches the page via phishing email or SMS text, they are instructed to click \u201cConfirm\u201d to view a message from \u201cExpress.\u201d","934":"This webpage has \u201cFedEx\u201d in the title and uses the same company colors to deceive the user.","935":"The user is also asked to permit push notifications in the browser, which allows the attacker to push malicious ads, as we will demonstrate later in this analysis. ","936":"Step 2 \u2013 The victim is informed that delivery of a package has been suspended, and that they need to schedule delivery and should enable push notifications to avoid future issues. ","937":"Step 3 \u2013 Then, the victim is informed that they need to pay a $1.95 customs fee.","938":"The customs fee is just an excuse to collect the victim\u2019s personal and credit card data in the next stage of the attack. ","939":"Behind the scenes, once the first page is loaded, the page sends a request to receive a customizable JSON that is used throughout the attack.","940":"The JSON includes the questions, form fields, and second-stage URLs, which will be all used in the next steps. ","941":"JSON containing data about the phishing. ","942":"Fake questions displayed by the phishing page. ","943":"Step 4 \u2013 The attacker continues to deceive the victim, in an attempt to add more credibility to the phish, by asking a series of questions to the victim, such as how, where, and when the victim would like to receive the package. ","944":"Step 5 \u2013 The deception continues by giving the victim a delivery estimate.","945":"As soon as the victim interacts with the questions on step 4, the phishing starts sending requests to the TrustedForm API.","946":"TrustedForm is a digital certificate service provided by ActiveProspect, which provides marketing automation and compliance platforms. ","947":"This service can be used to generate a digital certificate that includes information about a lead, such as geolocation, IP address, browser type, operating system, the time spent on the page, and even a web session replay.","948":"We believe that the attacker is creating a TrustedForm certificate to collect more information about victims. ","949":"Phishing page abusing TrustedForm. ","950":"Below is the type of information that would be available in a TrustedForm certificate, as demonstrated in their demo webpage. ","951":"Examples of a TrustedForm certificate generated by their demo page.

","1098":"On 30 March 2020 the first incoming transaction appears where the amount is split between 4 different bitcoin addresses.","1099":"A split like this is typically seen in Ransomware-as-a-Service, where the ransom payment is split between the RaaS operators and the affiliate who caused the infection.","1100":"In this first transaction, the split is 80%, 10% and two 5% portions.","1101":"This split matches the advertisement on the underground forum (80% \u2013 20%).

","1105":"Payments to the bc1q98 and 1DgLhG addresses that are not being split continue up until the end of May.","1106":"Possibly the initial NetWalker operators added a RaaS operation, while continuing to cause NetWalker infections themselves. ","1107":"While analyzing the bitcoin addresses that received 80% or more of the transaction amount, we noticed that there are some addresses that receive payments multiple times.","1108":"A possible explanation could be that the address is configured as payout addresses for a certain campaign or affiliate.","1109":"We identified 30 unique bitcoin addresses that seem to be the beneficiary of this larger portion of the ransom transaction.","1110":"Some of these only received one payment but there are several that received multiple payments.

","1113":"Amounts Extorted Working under the hypothesis that all the incoming transactions are ransomware payments; we can make the following observations: We found 23 transactions where the ransom payments were not split up and the beneficiaries are the two bitcoin addresses found by following the transactions mentioned in the underground forum post.","1114":"The total amount of bitcoin extorted this way between 1 March 2020 and 27 July 2020 is 677 BTC.","1115":"Additionally, the amount received from remaining transactions following the Ransomware-as-a-Service scheme by these addresses between 1 March 2020 and 27 July 2020 is 188 BTC. ","1116":"In the transactions that are split, the largest amount (usually 80% to 90% of the total transaction value) is presumably transferred to the affiliate that caused the infection.","1117":"When we summed up these largest portions, we saw a total of 1723 BTC being transferred to affiliates. ","1118":"The total amount of extorted bitcoin that has been uncovered by tracing transactions to these NetWalker related addresses is 2795 BTC between 1 March 2020 and 27 July 2020.","1119":"By using historic bitcoin to USD exchange rates, we estimate a total of 25 million USD was extorted with these NetWalker related transactions. ","1120":"Even though we do not have complete visibility into the BTC flow before NetWalker started ramping up, one thing is certain, this quarter alone it has been highly successful at extorting organisations for large amounts of money.","1121":"All this at a time when many sectors are struggling because people are sheltering in place and governments are trying to keep businesses from going bankrupt.","1122":"NetWalker is making millions off the backs of legitimate companies. ","1123":"Figure 25.","1124":"Overview of uncovered bitcoin transactions, highlighting the two identified actor addresses. ","1125":"Observed Changes While talking about the impact of NetWalker with our partners, we learned that the change in modus operandi not only affected the way the actors communicate with their victims.","1126":"When there was a change from email communication to a dedicated Tor hidden service, the actors also moved away from using legacy bitcoin addresses to SegWit addresses.","1127":"The benefits of using the newer SegWit addresses include faster transaction time and lower transaction cost.","1128":"The NetWalker advertisement on the underground forum mentions instant and fully automatic payments around the time of this observed change.","1129":"This makes us believe the ransomware actors were professionalizing their operation just before expanding to the Ransomware-as-a-Service model. ","1130":"Comparison with Previous Ransomware Given the sudden appearance of NetWalker ransomware and the associated threat actor, it suggests that some prior knowledge on ransomware development or underground presence had to be in place.","1131":"Armed with this hypothesis, we searched for possible links to underground actors and other ransomware strains that might fit the bill.","1132":"We came across one threat actor offering ransomware that caught our attention.","1133":"It was the use of the name NetWalker, in combination with a strong ransomware connection, that sparked our interest.

","1186":"Microsoft has been monitoring the rising popularity of OAuth application abuse.","1187":"One of the first observed malicious usage of OAuth applications in the wild is consent phishing.","1188":"Consent phishing attacks aim to trick users into granting permissions to malicious OAuth apps to gain access to user\u2019s legitimate cloud services (mail servers, files storage, management APIs, etc.).","1189":"In the past few years, Microsoft has observed that more and more threat actors, including nation-state actors, have been using OAuth applications for different malicious purposes \u2013 command-and-control (C2) communication, backdoors, phishing, redirections, and so on. ","1190":"This recent attack involved a network of single-tenant applications installed in compromised organizations being used as the actor\u2019s identity platform to perform the attack.","1191":"As soon as the network was revealed, all the related applications were taken down and notifications to customers were sent, including recommended remediation steps. ","1192":"This blog presents the technical analysis of this attack vector and the succeeding spam campaign attempted by the threat actor.","1193":"It also provides guidance for defenders on protecting organizations from this threat, and how Microsoft security technologies detect it. Figure 1.","1194":"Overview of the attack chain.","1195":"The time between application deployment and usage varied; there were cases where the actor took months before using the application.","1196":"Initial access For the attack to succeed, the threat actor needed to compromise cloud tenant users with sufficient permissions that would allow the actor to create an application in the cloud environment and give it admin consent.","1197":"The actor performed credential stuffing attacks against their targets, attempting to access users with the global admin role.","1198":"The authentication attempts, which originated from a single IP address, were launched against the Azure Active Directory PowerShell application (app ID: 1b730954-1685-4b74-9bfd-dac224a7b894).","1199":"The same application was later used to deploy the rest of the attack. ","1200":"Based on the success ratio of the authentication attempts, it is inferred that the attacker used a dump of compromised credentials.","1201":"The investigation also revealed that 86% of the compromised tenants had at least one admin with a real-time high risk score, which means they were flagged by Azure AD Identity Protection to be most likely compromised.","1202":"It is also important to note that all the compromised admins didn\u2019t have MFA enabled, which could have stopped the attack.","1203":"These observations amplify the importance of securing accounts and monitoring for high-risk users, especially those with high privileges. ","1204":"Deploying malicious OAuth application Once the threat actor gained access to privileged users, their next step was to set up the malicious application.","1205":"Based on analysis of the event user agent (Swagger-Codegen\/1.4.0.0\/csharp) and how quickly the deployment of the application was done, it is likely that the actor ran a PowerShell script to perform the following Azure Active Directory (AAD) management activities in all targeted tenants: Register a new single\u2013tenant application with the naming convention of [domain name]_([a-zA-Z]){3} (for example: Contoso_GhY)Add the legacy permission Exchange.ManageAsApp which can be used for app-only authentication of Exchange Online PowerShell moduleGrant admin consent to the above permissionGive global admin and Exchange admin roles to the previously registered applicationAdd application credentials (key\/certificate\/both) The threat actor added their own credentials to the OAuth application, which enabled them to access the application even if the initially compromised global administrator changed their password. ","1206":"The activities mentioned gave the threat actor control of a highly privileged application.","1207":"It was observed that the threat actor did not always use the application right after it was deployed.","1208":"In some cases, it took weeks or months before the application was utilized.","1209":"Also, in organizations that didn\u2019t monitor for suspicious applications, the applications were deployed for months and used multiple times by the threat actor. ","1210":"Modifying Exchange settings The threat actor used the privileged application to authenticate the Exchange Online PowerShell module and modify the Exchange settings of the compromised server.","1211":"There were two modifications which allowed them to perform the next step in the attack chain: Create a new inbound connector Connectors are a collection of instructions that customize the way email flows to and from organizations using Microsoft 365 or Office 365.","1212":"Most organizations using Microsoft 365 and Office 365 don\u2019t need custom connectors for regular mail flow, but some use it when they need to process messages from another messaging system that\u2019s not running Exchange, or if they have a network appliance that performs policy checks and then routes messages to their Exchange server. ","1213":"The threat actor set a new inbound connector with the naming convention Ran_([a-zA-Z]){5} (for example Ran_xAFzd).","1214":"The purpose of the inbound connector was to allow mails from certain IPs (that are related to the attacker\u2019s infrastructure) to flow through the victim\u2019s Exchange server.","1215":"This allowed the threat actor to send emails that looked like they originated from the compromised Exchange domain.","1216":"The configuration information for the newly created connectors were seen in Exchange audit event New-InboundConnector.","1217":"The following table shows the configuration parameters in the audit event related to this change: NameValue\u201cName\u201d\u201cRan_jBelh\u201d\u201cEnabled\u201d\u201cTrue\u201d\u201cCloudServicesMailEnabled\u201d\u201cTrue\u201d\u201cRestrictDomainsToCertificate\u201d\u201cFalse\u201d\u201cSenderDomains\u201d\u201csmtp:*;1\u201d\u201cSenderIPAddresses\u201d\u201c170.75.174.97;170.75.172.8;170.75.170.69;170.75.174.95; 54.39.94.145;149.56.200.36;158.69.21.185;66.70.201.131\u201d\u201cRestrictDomainsToIPAddresses\u201d\u201cTrue\u201d\u201cConnectorSource\u201d\u201cHybridWizard\u201d\u201cEFSkipIPs\u201d\u201c170.75.174.97;170.75.172.8;170.75.170.69;170.75.174.95; 54.39.94.145;149.56.200.36;158.69.21.185;66.70.201.131\u201d\u201cTreatMessagesAsInternal\u201d\u201cFalse\u201d\u201cConnectorType\u201d\u201cOnPremises\u201d\u201cRequireTls\u201d\u201cFalse\u201dCreate transport rules Transport rules (also known as mail flow rules) are sets of actions that can be taken on any mail that flows in the organization.","1218":"The threat actor utilized this feature to set 12 new transport rules with the naming convention of Test01 to Test012.","1219":"Each of these transport rules were responsible for deleting the following specific headers from every mail that flowed in the organization: X-MS-Exchange-ExternalOriginalInternetSenderX-MS-Exchange-SkipListedInternetSenderReceived-SPFReceivedARC-Authentication-ResultsARC-Message-SignatureDKIM-SignatureARC-SealX-MS-Exchange-SenderADCheckX-MS-Exchange-Authentication-ResultsAuthentication-ResultsX-MS-Exchange-AntiSpam-MessageData-ChunkCountBy deleting these headers, the attacker tried defense evasion to prevent security products or email providers detecting or blocking their emails and increase the success rate of the spam campaign.","1220":"The configuration information for the newly created transport rules were seen in Exchange audit event New-TransportRule.","1221":"The following table shows the configuration parameters in the audit event related to this change: NameValue\u201cName\u201d\u201cTest06\u201d\u201cSenderAddressLocation\u201d\u201cHeader\u201d\u201cRemoveHeader\u201d\u201cARC-Message-Signature\u201dThese modifications to the Exchange server settings allowed the threat actor to perform their primary goal in the attack: sending out spam emails.","1222":"After each spam campaign, the actor deleted the malicious inbound connector and transport rules to prevent detection, while the application remained deployed in the tenant until the next wave of the attack (in some cases, the app was dormant for months before it was reused by the threat actor).

","1244":"As the main initial access vector of the attack was to obtain the admin\u2019s credentials, we recommend organizations take the following steps to reduce their attack surface: Mitigate credential guessing attacks risks A key step in reducing the attack surface is securing the identity infrastructure.","1245":"The most common initial access vector observed in this attack was account compromise through credential stuffing, and all the compromised administrator accounts did not have MFA enabled.","1246":"Implementing security practices that strengthen account credentials such as enabling MFA raises the cost of an attack.

","1862":"This blog discusses the novel tactics and techniques leveraged in StellarParticle investigations conducted by CrowdStrike.","1863":"These techniques include: Credential hopping for obscuring lateral movement Office 365 (O365) Service Principal and Application hijacking, impersonation and manipulation Stealing browser cookies for bypassing multifactor authentication Use of the TrailBlazer implant and the Linux variant of GoldMax malware Credential theft using Get-ADReplAccount Credential Hopping The majority of StellarParticle-related investigations conducted by CrowdStrike have started with the identification of adversary actions within a victim\u2019s O365 environment.","1864":"This has been advantageous to CrowdStrike incident responders in that, through investigating victim O365 environments, they could gain an accurate accounting of time, account and source IP address of adversary victimization of the O365 tenant.","1865":"In multiple engagements, this led CrowdStrike incident responders to identify that the malicious authentications into victim O365 tenants had originated from within the victim\u2019s own network. ","1866":"Armed with this information, CrowdStrike investigators were able to identify from which systems in these internal networks the threat actor was making authentications to O365.","1867":"These authentications would typically occur from servers in the environment, leading to natural investigative questions: Why would a user authenticate into O365 from a domain controller or other infrastructure server?","1868":"What credentials were used as part of the session from which the O365 authentication occurred? ","1869":"This led our responders to identify the occurrence of \u201ccredential hopping,\u201d where the threat actor leveraged different credentials for each step while moving laterally through the victim\u2019s network.","1870":"While this particular technique is not necessarily unique to the StellarParticle campaign, it indicates a more advanced threat actor and may go unnoticed by a victim. ","1871":"Below is an example of how a threat actor performs credential hopping: Gain access to the victim\u2019s network by logging into a public-facing system via Secure Shell (SSH) using a local account <user sftp> acquired during previous credential theft activities. ","1872":"Use port forwarding capabilities built into SSH on the public-facing system to establish a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) session to an internal server (Server 1) using a domain service account.

","1881":"But how had the threat actor succeeded in authenticating into victim O365 tenants, when multifactor authentication (MFA) had been enabled for every O365 user account at each victim organization investigated by CrowdStrike? Cookie Theft to Bypass MFA Even though the victims required MFA to access cloud resources from all locations, including on premises, the threat actor managed to bypass MFA through the theft of Chrome browser cookies.","1882":"The threat actor accomplished this by using administrative accounts to connect via SMB to targeted users, and then copy their Chrome profile directories as well as data protection API (DPAPI) data.","1883":"In Windows, Chrome cookies and saved passwords are encrypted using DPAPI.","1884":"The user-specific encryption keys for DPAPI are stored under C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Protect\\. To leverage these encryption keys, the threat actor must first decrypt them, either by using the user account\u2019s Windows password, or, in Active Directory environments, by using a DPAPI domain backup key that is stored on domain controllers. ","1885":"Once the threat actor had a Chrome cookies file from a user that had already passed an MFA challenge recently (for example, a timeout was 24 hours), they decrypted the cookies file using the user\u2019s DPAPI key.","1886":"The cookies were then added to a new session using a \u201cCookie Editor\u201d Chrome extension that the threat actor installed on victim systems and removed after using. ","1887":"Shellbags, Falcon Telemetry and RDP Bitmap Cache From a forensic standpoint, the use of the Cookie Editor Chrome extension would have been challenging to identify, due to the threat actor\u2019s penchant for strict operational security.","1888":"This activity was identified via a NewScriptWritten event within Falcon when a JavaScript file was written to disk by a threat actor-initiated Chrome process.","1889":"This event captured the unique extension ID associated with the extension, thereby allowing CrowdStrike incident responders to validate via the Chrome Store that the JavaScript file was associated with the \u201cCookie Editor\u201d plugin.","1890":"This extension permitted bypassing MFA requirements, as the cookies, replayed through the Cookie Editor extension, allowed the threat actor to hijack the already MFA-approved session of a targeted user. ","1891":"Shellbags were also instrumental in identifying the cookie theft activity.","1892":"This artifact very clearly showed the threat actor accessing targeted users\u2019 machines in sequence and browsing to the Chrome and DPAPI directories one after another.","1893":"Parsing Shellbags for an administrative account leveraged by the threat actor resulted in entries similar to the below. ","1894":"Figure 2.","1895":"Shellbag artifacts showing targeting of Chrome directories CrowdStrike identified forensic evidence that showed the entire attack path: browsing to a target user\u2019s Chrome and DPAPI directories via administrative share, installing the Cookie Editor extension, and using Chrome to impersonate the targeted user in the victim\u2019s cloud tenants.","1896":"The decryption of the cookies is believed to have taken place offline after exfiltrating the data via the clipboard in the threat actor\u2019s RDP session. ","1897":"Figure 3.","1898":"Representation of lateral movement to cookie theft to O365 authentication CrowdStrike identified a similar TTP where the threat actor connected via RDP to a user\u2019s workstation with the workstation owner\u2019s account (e.g., connecting via RDP to user1-pc using the account user1).","1899":"In cases where the user had only locked their screen and not signed out, the threat actor was able to take over the user\u2019s Windows session, as the RDP session would connect to the existing session of the same user.","1900":"By examining RDP Bitmap Cache files, CrowdStrike was able to demonstrate that the threat actor had opened Chrome and exported all of the user\u2019s saved passwords as plaintext in a CSV file during these sessions. ","1901":"Figure 4. RDP Bitmap Cache reconstruction showing exportation of Chrome passwords In addition, the threat actor visited sensitive websites that the user had access to, which in one instance allowed them to browse and download a victim\u2019s customer list.","1902":"After this, the threat actor navigated to the user\u2019s Chrome history page and deleted the specific history items related to threat actor activity, leaving the rest of the user\u2019s Chrome history intact. ","1903":"O365 Delegated Administrator Abuse CrowdStrike also identified a connection between StellarParticle-related campaigns and the abuse of Microsoft Cloud Solution Partners\u2019 O365 tenants.","1904":"This threat actor abused access to accounts in the Cloud Solution Partner\u2019s environment with legitimate delegated administrative privileges to then gain access to several customers\u2019 O365 environments. ","1905":"By analyzing Azure AD sign-ins, CrowdStrike was able to use known indicators of compromise (IOCs) to identify several threat actor logins to customer environments.","1906":"These cross-tenant sign-ins were identified by looking for values in the resourceTenantId attribute that did not match the Cloud Solution Partner\u2019s own Azure tenant ID. ","1907":"CrowdStrike also identified a limitation within Microsoft\u2019s Delegated Administration capabilities for Microsoft Cloud Solution Partners.","1908":"While a normal O365 administrator can be provided dozens of specific administrative roles to limit the privileges granted, this same degree of customization cannot be applied to Microsoft Cloud Solution Partners that use the delegated administrator functionality in O365. ","1909":"For Microsoft Cloud Solution Partners, there are only two substantial administrative options today when managing a customer\u2019s environment, Admin agent or Helpdesk agent.2","1910":"The Helpdesk agent role provides very limited access that is equivalent to a password admin role, whereas the Admin agent role provides broad access more equivalent to global administrator.","1911":"This limitation is scheduled to be resolved in 2022 via Microsoft\u2019s scheduled feature, Granular Delegated Admin Privileges (GDAP).3 User Access Logging (UAL) ","1912":"The Windows User Access Logging (UAL) database is an extremely powerful artifact that has played an instrumental role in the investigation of StellarParticle-linked cases.","1913":"In particular, UAL has helped our responders identify earlier malicious account usage that ultimately led to the identification of the aforementioned TrailBlazer implant and Linux version of the GoldMax variant.

","1919":"In multiple StellarParticle-related cases, because the threat actor used the same set of accounts during their operations in the environment, CrowdStrike was able to identify previous malicious activity going back multiple years, based solely on UAL data.","1920":"Even though it\u2019s only available on Server 2012 and up, UAL can still be used to trace evidence of threat actor activity on legacy systems as long as the activity on the legacy system involves some (deliberate or unintentional) access to a 2012+ system.","1921":"For example, in addition to tracking SMB activity, UAL databases on Domain Controllers track Active Directory access. ","1922":"This allowed CrowdStrike to demonstrate that a given user account was also authenticating to Active Directory from a given source IP address two years prior.","1923":"Because the user account was known to have recently been abused by the threat actor, and the source IP of the system in question was not one that account would typically be active on, the investigation led to the source system and ultimately resulted in the timeline of malicious activity being pushed back by years, with additional compromised systems even being discovered still running unique malware from that time period. ","1924":"TrailBlazer and GoldMax Throughout StellarParticle-related investigations, CrowdStrike has identified two sophisticated malware families that were placed on victim systems in the mid-2019 timeframe: a Linux variant of GoldMax and a completely new family CrowdStrike refers to as TrailBlazer.

","1965":"The threat actor\u2019s wiki access could be considered an extension of \u201cCredential Hopping\u201d described earlier.","1966":"The threat actor established RDP sessions to internal servers using privileged accounts and then accessed the wiki using a different set of credentials.","1967":"CrowdStrike observed the threat actor accessing the wiki as users who would be considered \u201cnon-privileged\u201d from an Active Directory perspective but had access to sensitive data specific to the victim\u2019s products or services. ","1968":"At this time, the malicious access of internal wikis is an information gathering technique that CrowdStrike has only observed in StellarParticle investigations.","1969":"CrowdStrike was able to identify the wiki access primarily through forensic analysis of the internal systems used by the threat actor.","1970":"Given the threat actor\u2019s penchant for clearing browser data, organizations should not rely upon the availability of these artifacts for future investigations.","1971":"CrowdStrike recommends the following best practices for internal information repositories: Enable detailed access logging Ensure logs are centralized and stored for at least 180 days Create detections for anomalous activity such as access from an unusual location like a server subnet Enable MFA on the repository site, or provide access via Single Sign On (SSO) behind MFA O365 Built-in Service Principal Hijacking The threat actor connected via Remote Desktop from a Domain Controller to a vCenter server and opened a PowerShell console, then used the PowerShell command -ep bypass to circumvent the execution policy.","1972":"Using the Windows Azure Active Directory PowerShell Module, the threat actor connected to the victim\u2019s O365 tenant and began performing enumeration queries.","1973":"These queries were recorded in text-based logs that existed under the path C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office365\\Powershell\\.

","2004":"By running the commands from within the victim\u2019s environment, MFA requirements were bypassed due to conditional access policies not covering Service Principal sign-ins at this point of time.8 However, as explained earlier, the threat actor managed to continue to access the victim\u2019s cloud environment even when the victim enforced MFA for all connections regardless of source. ","2005":"While the bulk of the evidence for this activity came from the text-based O365 PowerShell logs, the NTUSER.DAT registry hive for the user that was running the PowerShell cmdlets also included information on the accounts that were used to authenticate to the cloud.","2006":"This information was stored under the registry path.","2007":"Below is an example of the registry data: Figure 6.","2008":"Example registry entry showing target O365 email accounts The same WSMan connection string was also located in the user\u2019s NTUSER.DAT registry hive under the path: Figure 7.","2009":"WSMan connection string registry location While not strictly related to the O365 PowerShell activity, the Windows Event Log Microsoft-Windows-WinRM%4Operational.evtx also included information on connection attempts made to external O365 tenants.","2010":"This information was logged under Event ID 6.","2011":"Below is an example of what the event included: Figure 8.","2012":"Windows Event Log entry showing connection to O365 tenants O365 Company Service Principal Manipulation ","2013":"The threat actor also deployed several layers of persistence utilizing both pre-existing and threat actor-created Service Principals with the ultimate goal of gaining global access to email. ","2014":"Attacker-created Service Principal First, the threat actor used a compromised O365 administrator account to create a new Service Principal with a generic name.","2015":"This Service Principal was granted company administrator privileges.","2016":"From there, the threat actor added a credential to this Service Principal so that they could access the Service Principal directly, without use of an O365 user account.

","2025":"CrowdStrike was able to use the Unified Audit Logs\u2019 (UAL) MailItemsAccessed operation events to see the exact emails the threat actor viewed, as the majority of the users in the tenant were assigned O365 E5 licenses.","2026":"When performing analysis on the UAL, CrowdStrike used the ClientAppId value within the MailItemsAccessed operation and cross-correlated with the Application ID of the compromised service principal to see what activities were performed by the threat actor. ","2027":"O365 Application Impersonation Another consistent TTP identified during StellarParticle investigations has been the abuse of the ApplicationImpersonation9 role.","2028":"When this role was assigned to a particular user that was controlled by the threat actor, it allowed the threat actor to impersonate any user within the O365 environment.","2029":"These impersonated events are not logged verbosely by the Unified Audit Logs and can be difficult to detect. ","2030":"While the assignment of these ApplicationImpersonation roles were not logged in the Unified Audit Logs, CrowdStrike was able to identify this persistence mechanism via the management role configuration settings, which can be exported with the Exchange PowerShell command: Get-ManagementRoleAssignment -Role ApplicationImpersonation. ","2031":"CrowdStrike then analyzed the exported configuration settings and identified several users (not service accounts) that the threat actor likely gave direct ApplicationImpersonation roles during the known periods of compromise. ","2032":"Remote Tasklist The threat actor attempted to remotely list running processes on systems using tasklist.exe.","2033":"As tasklist uses WMI \u201cunder the hood,\u201d this activity was captured by Falcon as SuspiciousWmiQuery events that included the query and the source system.","2034":"Additionally, the failed (not successful) process listing resulted in a DCOM error that was logged in the System.evtx event log under Event ID 10028.","2035":"A sample of the information included with this event is below: Figure 9.","2036":"Event ID 10028 showing failed execution of remote tasklist This remote process listing was consistently used by the threat actor targeting the same or similar lists of remote systems, and the owners of the targeted systems also happened to be the individuals with cloud access that the threat actor was interested in.","2037":"While unproven, it\u2019s possible the threat actor was running tasklist remotely on these systems specifically to see which of the target systems was running Google Chrome.","2038":"This is because a current or recent Chrome session to the victim\u2019s cloud tenants would be potentially beneficial in the hijacking of sessions that the threat actor performed in order to access the victim\u2019s cloud resources. ","2039":"FTP Scanning\/Identity Knowledge ","2040":"In one instance, after being evicted from a victim environment, the threat actor began probing external services as a means to regain access, initially focusing on (S)FTP servers that were internet-accessible.","2041":"Logs on the servers indicated that the threat actor attempted to log in with multiple valid accounts and in several cases was successful.","2042":"There was little to no activity during the (S)FTP sessions.","2043":"This likely was an exercise in attempting to identify misconfigured (S)FTP accounts that also had shell access, similar to what\u2019s described in the Credential Hopping section earlier.","2044":"Some of the accounts used were not in the victim\u2019s Active Directory, as these were accounts for customers of the victim and stored in a separate LDAP database.","2045":"However, the threat actor had knowledge of these accounts and used them on the correct systems, which further confirmed that the threat actor had advanced knowledge of the victim\u2019s environment. ","2046":"After confirming the FTP accounts did not provide shell access into the environment, the threat actor began attempting to connect into the environment via VPN.","2047":"The threat actor attempted to log in to the VPN using several user accounts but was prevented from connecting, either due to not having the correct password, or due to having the correct password but not getting past the recently implemented MFA requirement.","2048":"Eventually, the threat actor attempted an account that they had the correct password for but that had not been set up with MFA.","2049":"This resulted in a prompt being displayed to the threat actor that included an MFA setup link.","2050":"The threat actor subsequently set up MFA for the account and successfully connected to the victim\u2019s network via VPN. ","2051":"TA Masquerading of System Names During the attempted and successful VPN authentications described above, the threat actor ensured the hostname of their system matched the naming convention of hostnames in the victim\u2019s environment.","2052":"This again showed a strong knowledge of the victim\u2019s internal environment on the part of the threat actor.","2053":"Not only did the masqueraded hostnames follow the correct naming convention from a broad perspective, they were also valid in terms of what would be expected for the user account the threat actor leveraged (i.e., in terms of the site name and asset type indicated in the hostname).","2054":"This masqueraded hostname technique has been observed at multiple StellarParticle-related investigations. ","2055":"Credential Theft Using Get-ADReplAccount ","2056":"In one example, the threat actor connected into the victim\u2019s environment via a VPN endpoint that did not have MFA enabled.","2057":"Once connected to the VPN, the threat actor connected via Remote Desktop to a Domain Controller and copied the DSInternals10 PowerShell module to the system.","2058":"The threat actor subsequently ran the DSInternals command Get-ADReplAccount targeting two of the victim\u2019s domains.","2059":"This command uses the Microsoft Directory Replication Service (MS-DRSR) protocol and specifically the IDL_DRSGetNCChanges method to return account information from Active Directory such as the current NTLM password hashes and previous password hashes used for enforcing password reuse restrictions.","2060":"A common name for this particular technique is DCSync.11 An example output from Get-AdReplAccount is below: DistinguishedName: CN=TestUser,OU=Admins,OU=Users,DC=demo,DC=local Sid: S-1-5-21-1432446722-301123485-1266542393-2012 Guid: 12321930-7c05-4011-8a3e-e0b9b6e04567 SamAccountName: TestUser SamAccountType: User UserPrincipalName: TestUser@demo.local PrimaryGroupId: 513 SidHistory: Enabled: True UserAccountControl:","2061":"NormalAccount AdminCount: True Deleted: False LastLogonDate: 12\/2\/2021 1:41:46 PM DisplayName: TestUser GivenName: Test Surname: User Description: Admin Account ServicePrincipalName: SecurityDescriptor: DiscretionaryAclPresent, SystemAclPresent, DiscretionaryAclAutoInherited, SystemAclAutoInherited, DiscretionaryAclProtected, SelfRelative Owner: S-1-5-21-1432446722-301123485-1266542393-512 Secrets NTHash: 84a058676bb6d7de4237e18f09b91156 LMHash: NTHashHistory: Hash 01: 84a058676bb6d7de4237e18f09b91156 Hash 02: e047ebb3b7c463928c928fca95ac0ac8 Hash 03: 6dc3cdb3e559ef00d3521351ace7477e Hash 04: a88355849f35fe7336de23a4ca3e6a9e Hash 05: de9bde95677672295349aa6e1e857704 LMHashHistory: ","2062":"Hash 01: 12227358dd7013c7dbdbd8fdcc0c6668 Hash 02: 6a028636a6f52491424586bb88357f7c Hash 03: c13ef7347853dc3be7e7259fdc8818a1 Hash 04: 6635151746869ce485246037747adae1 Hash 05: 85543f498b007e07a3da662c8a9d450b SupplementalCredentials: ClearText: ","2063":"NTLMStrongHash: de164e3465f163e846a5e1c22a5ac649 Kerberos: Credentials: DES_CBC_MD5 Key: 0013364f00003915 DES_CBC_CRC Key: 0013364f00003915 OldCredentials: DES_CBC_MD5 Key: 00002a46000004bc DES_CBC_CRC Key: 00002a46000004bc Salt: demo.localTestUser Flags: 0 KerberosNew: Credentials: AES256_CTS_HMAC_SHA1_96 Key: afd4d60e8d0920bc2f94d551f62f0ea2a17523bf2ff8ffb0fdade2a90389282f Iterations: 4096 AES128_CTS_HMAC_SHA1_96 Key: f67c2bcbfcfa30fccb36f72dca22a817 Iterations: 4096 DES_CBC_MD5 Key: 00002f34000004ee Iterations: 4096 DES_CBC_CRC Key: 00002f34000004ee Iterations: 4096 OldCredentials: AES256_CTS_HMAC_SHA1_96 Key: b430783ab4c957cf6a03d3d348af27264c0d872932650ffca712d9ebcf778b9f Iterations: 4096 AES128_CTS_HMAC_SHA1_96 Key: dc34bfd5e469edbeada77fac56aa35ae Iterations: 4096 DES_CBC_MD5 Key: 0000345400000520 Iterations: 4096 DES_CBC_CRC Key: 0000345400000520 Iterations: 4096 OlderCredentials: AES256_CTS_HMAC_SHA1_96 Key: 26efd3593712e555f8366bb4b8aff097d09acd93c3a1b6d4ea03c578aad9e087 Iterations:","2064":"4096 AES128_CTS_HMAC_SHA1_96 Key: c38dfbd6c00b5f3b010a07f9e824fc38 Iterations: 4096 DES_CBC_MD5 Key: 000039a500000551 Iterations: 4096 DES_CBC_CRC Key: 000039a500000551 Iterations: 4096 ServiceCredentials: Salt:","2065":"demo.localTestUser DefaultIterationCount: 4096 Flags: 0 WDigest: Hash 01: 83ed141ab0eaf1ff7694147ba97e1994 Hash 02: e73a8c05d4a7df53774bfa7ef8f0f574 Hash 03: 0c228c5816a79e561d999d489499a12a Hash 04: 83ed141ab0eaf1ff7694147ba97e1994 Hash 05: e73a8c05d4a7df53774bfa7ef8f0f574 Hash 06: 4e7c5ec6ffb6100f0c7f0bc57749bc93 Hash 07: 83ed141ab0eaf1ff7694147ba97e1994 Hash 08: 10265b08a3bb710da516832eaf64368a Hash 09: 10265b08a3bb710da516832eaf64368a Key Credentials: Credential Roaming Created: Modified: Credentials: Figure 10.","2066":"Get-ADReplAccount example output When executing the Get-ADReplAccount command, the threat actor specified the AD context to be targeted via the NamingContext parameter.","2067":"This was necessary, as the threat actor was targeting multiple domains.","2068":"The resulting output of each command was redirected to a text file and compressed as zip archives before exfiltration.

","2201":"As we reviewed available reports on the 3CX attack, we began wondering if the compromise concluded with the infostealer or further implants followed.","2202":"To answer that question, we decided to review the telemetry we had on the campaign.","2203":"On one of the machines, we observed a DLL named guard64.dll, which was loaded into the infected 3CXDesktopApp.exe process.","2204":"Interestingly enough, we opened an investigation into a case linked to that DLL on March 21, about a week before the supply chain attack was discovered.","2205":"A DLL with that name was used in recent deployments of a backdoor that we dubbed \u201cGopuram\u201d and had been tracking internally since 2020.","2206":"Three years ago, we were investigating an infection of a cryptocurrency company located in Southeast Asia.","2207":"During the investigation, we found that Gopuram coexisted on victim machines with AppleJeus, a backdoor attributed to the Korean-speaking threat actor Lazarus. ","2208":"Over the years, we observed few victims compromised with Gopuram, but the number of infections began to increase in March 2023.","2209":"As it turned out, the increase was directly related to the 3CX supply chain attack.","2210":"We found out that the threat actor specifically targeted cryptocurrency companies, dropping the following files on infected machines: C:\\Windows\\system32\\wlbsctrl.dll, a malicious library (MD5: 9f85a07d4b4abff82ca18d990f062a84); C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\TxR\\<machine hardware profile GUID>.TxR.0.regtrans-ms, an encrypted shellcode payload.

","2213":"The wlbsctrl.dll library is responsible for decrypting and executing the shellcode stored in the C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\TxR directory.","2214":"The decryption is notably performed through the CryptUnprotectData API function that uses a different encryption key internally on every machine.","2215":"This makes it difficult for researchers to decrypt the payload from the file without physical access to the victim machines. ","2216":"Snippet of the loading function using CryptUnprotectData The component loaded by the library is Gopuram\u2019s main module.","2217":"As mentioned above, its name in the export directory is guard64.dll.","2218":"The job of the main module is to connect to a C2 server and request commands.","2219":"The backdoor implements commands that allow the attackers to interact with the victim\u2019s file system and create processes on the infected machine.","2220":"Gopuram was additionally observed to launch in-memory modules.","2221":"Just like the implants used in the 3CX campaign, Gopuram\u2019s modules are DLL files that include an export function named DllGetClassObject.","2222":"We have observed eight modules so far: Module name Description Ping Pings a host specified in the argument.

","2234":"The discovery of the new Gopuram infections allowed us to attribute the 3CX campaign to the Lazarus threat actor with medium to high confidence.","2235":"Our attribution is based on the following facts: While investigating an attack on a Southeast Asian cryptocurrency company in 2020, we found Gopuram coexisting on the same machine with the AppleJeus backdoor, which is attributed to Lazarus. ","2236":"The Gopuram backdoor has been observed in attacks on cryptocurrency companies, which is aligned with the interests of the Lazarus threat actor. ","2237":"While looking for additional implants that used the same loader shellcode as the 3CX implants, we discovered a sample on a multiscanner service (MD5: 933508a9832da1150fcfdbc1ca9bc84c) loading a payload that uses the wirexpro[.]com C2 server.","2238":"The same server is listed as an IoC for an AppleJeus campaign by Malwarebytes. ","2239":"First bytes of the loader shellcode used in 3CX and AppleJeus Note, though, that the shellcode is based on open-source code that has been used by other threat actors, for example, SilentBreak.","2240":"Still, the use of that shellcode along with the 0xF558F4DA constant (which is the ROR13 hash for the string DllGetClassObject) is a more unique pattern. ","2241":"While investigating a malicious MSI file (MD5: ec3f99dd7d9dbce8d704d407b086e84f) that has been uploaded to a multiscanner service, we observed the following two events: The dll library dropped from the MSI was observed to launch an in-memory payload that contacts the oilycargo[.]com domain.","2242":"This domain name has previously been attributed to Lazarus by multiple researchers. ","2243":"In our telemetry, we observed AvBugReport.exe, the executable hosting dll, to contain Gopuram\u2019s main module payload, guard64.dll. ","2244":"These four facts allow us to conclude that Lazarus is likely the threat actor deploying the Gopuram backdoor. ","2245":"As for the victims in our telemetry, installations of the infected 3CX software are located all over the world, with the highest infection figures observed in Brazil, Germany, Italy and France. ","2246":"As the Gopuram backdoor has been deployed to less than ten infected machines, it indicates that attackers used Gopuram with surgical precision.","2247":"We additionally observed that the attackers have a specific interest in cryptocurrency companies. ","2248":"As it turns out, the infostealer is not the only malicious payload deployed during the 3CX supply chain attack.","2249":"The threat actor behind Gopuram additionally infects target machines with the full-fledged modular Gopuram backdoor.","2250":"We believe that Gopuram is the main implant and the final payload in the attack chain.","2251":"Our investigation of the 3CX campaign is still far from complete.","2252":"We will continue analyzing the deployed implants to find out more details about the toolset used in the supply chain attack.

","2356":"The attackers The attacks we saw in 2020 share some TTPs with previous reports about groups targeting Colombia, but also differ in many ways, thus making attribution difficult. ","2357":"One of those reports was published in February 2019, by QiAnXin researchers.","2358":"The operations described in that blogpost are connected to an APT group active since at least April 2018.","2359":"We have found some similarities between those attacks and the ones that we describe in this article: We saw a malicious sample included in IoCs of QiAnXin\u2019s report and a sample from the new campaign in the same government organization.","2360":"These files have fewer than a dozen sightings each. ","2361":"Some of the phishing emails from the current campaign were sent from IP addresses corresponding to a range that belongs to Powerhouse Management, a VPN service.","2362":"The same IP address range was used for emails sent in the earlier campaign. ","2363":"The phishing emails have similar topics and pretend to come from some of the same entities \u2013 for example, the Office of the Attorney General (Fiscalia General de la Nacion) or the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs (DIAN). ","2364":"Some of the C&C servers in Operation Spalax use linkpc.net and publicvm.com subdomains, along with IP addresses that belong to Powerhouse Management.","2365":"This also happened in the earlier campaign. ","2366":"However, there are differences in the attachments used for phishing emails, the remote access trojans (RATs) used and in most of the operator\u2019s C&C infrastructure. ","2367":"There is also this report from Trend Micro, from July 2019.","2368":"There are similarities between the phishing emails and parts of the network infrastructure in that campaign and the one we describe here.","2369":"The attacks described in that article were connected to cybercrime, not espionage.","2370":"While we have not seen any payload delivered by the attackers other than RATs, some of the targets in the current campaign (such as a lottery agency) don\u2019t make much sense for spying activities. ","2371":"These threat actors show perfect usage of the Spanish language in the emails they send, they only target Colombian entities, and they use premade malware and don\u2019t develop any themselves. ","2372":"Attack overview Targets are approached with emails that lead to the download of malicious files.","2373":"In most cases, these emails have a PDF document attached, which contains a link that the user must click to download the malware.","2374":"The downloaded files are regular RAR archives that have an executable file inside.","2375":"These archives are hosted in legitimate file hosting services such as OneDrive or MediaFire.","2376":"The target has to manually extract the file and execute it for the malware to run. ","2377":"We\u2019ve found a variety of packers used for these executables, but their purpose is always to have a remote access trojan running on the victimized computer, usually by decrypting the payload and injecting it into legitimate processes.","2378":"An overview of a typical attack is shown in Figure 1.","2379":"We have seen the attackers use three different RATs: Remcos, njRAT and AsyncRAT. Figure 1.","2380":"Overview of the attack Phishing emails The attackers use various topics for their emails, but in most cases they are not specially crafted for their victims.","2381":"On the contrary, most of these emails have generic topics that could be reused for different targets. ","2382":"We found phishing emails with these topics: A notification about a driving infraction A notification to take a mandatory COVID-19 test A notification to attend a court hearing An open investigation against the recipient for misuse of public funds A notification of an embargo of bank accounts The email shown in Figure 2 pretends to be a notification about a driving infraction for a value of around US$250.","2383":"There is a PDF file attached that promises a photo of the infraction, as well as information about time and place of the incident.","2384":"The sender has been spoofed to make the email look like it is coming from SIMIT (a system for paying transit violations in Colombia). ","2385":"Figure 2.","2386":"Example of a phishing email The pdf file only contains an external link that has been shortened with the acortaurl service, as shown in Figure 3.","2387":"The shortened URL is: https:\/\/acortaurl[.]com\/httpsbogotagovcohttpsbogotagovcohttpsbogotagovco.

","2394":"Figure 4.","2395":"Header of a phishing email In more recent emails, the shortened link in the PDF file resolves to https:\/\/bogota.gov[.]co (a legitimate site) when visited from outside of Colombia. ","2396":"Also, in some cases the GetResponse service has been used to send the email.","2397":"This is probably done to track whether the victim has clicked on the link.","2398":"In these cases there is no attachment: a link to the GetResponse platform leads to the download of malware. ","2399":"You can see the other emails in the following gallery (click to enlarge): Figures 5 to 13.","2400":"Various phishing emails and their attached files Malicious artifacts Droppers The executable files contained in compressed archives that are downloaded via the phishing emails are responsible for decrypting and running remote access trojans on a victimized computer.","2401":"In the following sections, we describe the various droppers we have seen. ","2402":"NSIS installers The dropper that is most commonly used by these attackers comes as a file that was compiled with NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System).","2403":"To try to evade detection, this installer contains several benign files that are written to disk (they are not part of NSIS binaries and they are not used at all by the installer) and two files that are malicious: an encrypted RAT executable and a DLL file that decrypts and runs the trojan.","2404":"An NSIS script for one of these installers is shown in Figure 14.","2405":"The benign files are usually different in different droppers used by the attackers. ","2406":"Figure 14.","2407":"NSIS script for one of the droppers; the malicious files are highlighted The files Bonehead (encrypted RAT) and ShoonCataclysm.dll (dropper DLL) are written in the same folder and the DLL is run with rundll32.exe using Uboats as its argument.","2408":"The names of these files change between executables.","2409":"Some more examples are: rundll32.exe","2410":"Blackface,Breathing rundll32.exe OximeLied,Hostage rundll32.exe Conservatory,Piggins ","2411":"We used the name of the benign files contained in some of these NSIS installers to find more malicious installers used by the Spalax operators.","2412":"Table 1 lists details of three different NSIS installers used by the attackers that contained all the same benign files.","2413":"The only difference among them was the encrypted file, which pointed to different C&C servers. ","2414":"Table 1.","2415":"NSIS installers with identical benign files used by this group SHA-1C&C ","2416":"6E81343018136B271D1F95DB536CA6B2FD1DFCD6marzoorganigrama20202020.duckdns[.]org 7EDB738018E0E91C257A6FC94BDBA50DAF899F90ruthy.qdp6fj1uji[.]xyz 812A407516F9712C80B70A14D6CDF282C88938C1dominoduck2098.duckdns[.]org ","2417":"However, we also found malicious NSIS installers used by other unrelated groups that had the same benign files as the ones used by this group.","2418":"Figure 15 lists the files contained in two different NSIS installers.","2419":"The one on the left (SHA-1: 3AC39B5944019244E7E33999A2816304558FB1E8) is an executable used by this group and the one on the right (SHA-1: 6758741212F7AA2B77C42B2A2DE377D97154F860) is unrelated.","2420":"The SHA-1 hashes for all the benign files are the same (and also the filenames) and even the malicious DLL is the same.","2421":"However, the encrypted file Bonehead is different. ","2422":"Figure 15.","2423":"Files contained in NSIS droppers from unrelated campaigns This means that these installers were generated with the same builder, but by different actors.","2424":"The builder is probably offered in underground forums and includes these benign files.","2425":"This, along with a complete analysis of the dropper, was described earlier this year by Sophos in their RATicate article.","2426":"There is also an article by Lab52 describing one of the NSIS installers used in Operation Spalax, which they attribute to APT-C-36. ","2427":"In the vast majority of cases these NSIS droppers decrypt and run the Remcos RAT, but we have also seen cases where the payload is njRAT.","2428":"These will be described later in the Payloads section. ","2429":"Agent Tesla packers We have seen several droppers that are different variants of a packer that uses steganography and is known to be used in Agent Tesla samples.","2430":"Interestingly, the attackers use various payloads, but none of them are Agent Tesla.","2431":"Even though there are differences in all the samples regarding the layers of encryption, obfuscation or anti-analysis used, we can summarize the actions taken by the droppers as follows: The dropper reads a string (or binary data) from its resource section and decrypts it.","2432":"The result is a DLL that will be loaded and called in the same address space. ","2433":"The DLL reads pixels from an image contained in the first binary and decrypts another executable.","2434":"This one is loaded and executed in the same address space. ","2435":"This new executable is packed with CyaX. It reads data from its own resource section and decrypts a payload.","2436":"There are anti-analysis checks; if they pass, the payload can be injected into a new process or loaded in the same process space. ","2437":"The initial dropper is coded in C#.","2438":"In all the samples that we have seen, the code for the dropper was hiding in non-malicious code, probably copied from other apps.","2439":"The benign code is not executed; it\u2019s there to evade detection. ","2440":"In Figure 16 we see an example of the resources contained in one of these droppers.","2441":"The text in green (only shown partially) is a string that will be decrypted to generate the next stage to be executed and the image that we see below the green text will be decrypted by the second stage malware.","2442":"The algorithm used for decryption of the string varies from sample to sample, but sometimes the resource is just an unencrypted binary. ","2443":"Figure 16.","2444":"Resources contained in Agent Tesla\u2019s packer ","2445":"The method to be executed in the DLL is always named StartGame or StartUpdate.","2446":"It reads the image from the first executable, and stores every pixel as three numbers according to its red, green and blue components.","2447":"Then it decrypts the array by doing a single-byte XOR operation, cycling through the key.","2448":"After that, the array is gzip-decompressed and executed.","2449":"Part of the code for the mentioned operations is shown in Figure 17. Figure 17.","2450":"Code to decrypt and run the third-stage malware The third stage is in charge of decrypting and running the payload.","2451":"The .NET packer known as CyaX is used to perform this task.","2452":"The version of the packer used by the attackers is v4, although they used v2 in some cases.","2453":"Figure 18 shows the hardcoded configuration for one of their samples. ","2454":"Figure 18.","2455":"Hardcoded configuration in CyaX-Sharp packer ","2456":"The decryption of the payload is based on XOR operations and is the same as the algorithm previously shown but with an extra step: the payload is XORed with its first 16 bytes as a key.","2457":"Once it\u2019s decrypted, it can be run in the same address space or injected into a different process, depending on the configuration. ","2458":"This packer supports various anti-analysis operations such as disabling Windows Defender, checking for security products, and detecting virtual environments and sandboxes. ","2459":"The majority of the payloads for these droppers are njRAT, but we have also seen AsyncRAT.","2460":"We saw Remcos in one of these droppers, but the code in the packer was different.","2461":"Part of the main routine for the injection of the payload is shown in Figure 19. Figure 19.","2462":"Code for the last stage of a dropper We have noticed that the configuration is contained in different variables.","2463":"Values like #startup_method# or #bind# mean that the configuration was not set for those options.","2464":"The payload is read from an encrypted resource and XORed with a hardcoded password.","2465":"The shellcode that performs the injection is contained in an array and is dynamically loaded.","2466":"There are no anti-analysis checks or protection mechanisms.

","2488":"Payloads The payloads used in Operation Spalax are remote access trojans.","2489":"These provide several capabilities not only for remote control, but also for spying on targets: keylogging, screen capture, clipboard hijacking, exfiltration of files, and the ability to download and execute other malware, to name a few. ","2490":"These RATs were not developed by the attackers.","2491":"They are: Remcos, sold online njRAT, leaked in underground forums AsyncRAT, open source There is not a one-to-one relationship between droppers and payloads, as we have seen different types of droppers running the same payload and also a single type of dropper connected to different payloads.","2492":"However, we can state that NSIS droppers mostly drop Remcos, while Agent Tesla and AutoIt packers typically drop njRAT. ","2493":"Remcos is a tool for remote control and surveillance.","2494":"It can be purchased with a six-month license that includes updates and support.","2495":"There is also a free version with limited functionalities.","2496":"While the tool can be used for legitimate purposes, it is also used by criminals to spy on their victims. ","2497":"Most of the Remcos samples used by this group are v2.5.0 Pro, but we have also seen all versions that were released since September 2019, which may indicate that the attackers bought a license after that month and have been actively using the different updates that they received during their six month license period. ","2498":"Regarding njRAT, this group mostly uses v0.7.3 (also known as the Lime version).","2499":"That version includes functionalities such as DDoS or ransomware encryption, but only spy features such as keylogging are used by the attackers.","2500":"For a more complete description of this version, refer to this 2018 article by Zscaler. ","2501":"Another njRAT version used by the attackers is v0.7d (the \u201cgreen edition\u201d) which is a simpler version focused on spying capabilities: keylogging, taking screenshots, access to webcam and microphone, uploading and downloading files, and executing other binaries. ","2502":"The final type of payload that we will mention is AsyncRAT.","2503":"In all cases we have observed v0.5.7B, which can be found on GitHub, has been used.","2504":"The functionalities in this RAT are similar to those in the previously mentioned RATs, which allow attackers to spy on their victims. ","2505":"Network infrastructure During our research we saw approximately 70 different domain names used for C&C in the second half of 2020.","2506":"This amounts to at least 24 IP addresses.","2507":"By pivoting on passive DNS data for IP addresses and known domain names, we found that the attackers have used at least 160 additional domain names since 2019.","2508":"This corresponds to at least 40 further IP addresses. ","2509":"They\u2019ve managed to operate at such scale by using Dynamic DNS services.","2510":"This means that they have a pool of domain names (and also register new ones on a regular basis) that are dynamically assigned to IP addresses.","2511":"This way a domain name can be related to several IP addresses over a period of time and IP addresses can be related to many domain names.","2512":"Most of the domain names we have seen were registered with Duck DNS, but they have also used DNS Exit for publicvm.com and linkpc.net subdomains. ","2513":"Regarding IP addresses, almost all of them are in Colombia.","2514":"Most are IP addresses related to Colombian ISPs: 60% of them are Telmex and 30% EPM Telecomunicaciones (Tigo).","2515":"As it is highly unlikely that the criminals own so many residential IP addresses, it is possible that they use some victims as proxies, or some vulnerable devices to forward communication to their real C&C servers. ","2516":"Finally, a subset of the IP addresses belongs to Powerhouse Management, a VPN service provider.","2517":"They are used in conjunction with DNS Exit subdomains.","2518":"Similar findings can be found in this analysis by Lab52. Conclusion Targeted malware attacks against Colombian entities have been scaled up since the campaigns that were described last year.","2519":"The landscape has changed from a campaign that had a handful of C&C servers and domain names to a campaign with very large and fast-changing infrastructure with hundreds of domain names used since 2019.","2520":"Even though TTPs have seen changes, not only in how malware is delivered in phishing emails but also in the RATs used, one aspect that remains the same is that the attacks are still targeted and focused on Colombian entities, both in the public and private sectors.","2521":"It should be expected that these attacks will continue in the region for a long time, so we will keep monitoring these activities.

","2591":"Our findings can be summarised as below: Access and scraping of corporate Microsoft SharePoint sites in order to identify any credentials which may be stored in technical documentation.","2592":"Access to local password managers and databases to obtain further credentials and escalate privileges.","2593":"Living of the land \u2013 tools such as RVTools to shut down servers and ADExplorer to perform reconnaissance.","2594":"Cloning of git repositories and extraction of sensitive API Keys.","2595":"Using compromised credentials to access corporate VPNs.","2596":"Disruption or destruction to victim infrastructure to hinder analysis and consume defensive resource. ","2597":"Summary LAPSUS$ first appeared publicly in December 2021, however, NCC Group first observed LAPSUS$ months prior during an incident response engagement.","2598":"We believe the group has also operated prior to this date, though perhaps not under the \u201cLAPSUS$\u201d banner. ","2599":"Over the last 5 months, LAPSUS$ has gained large notoriety with some successful breaches of some large enterprises including, Microsoft, Nvidia, Okta & Samsung.","2600":"Little is still known about this group with motivations appearing to be for reputation, money and \u201cfor the lulz\u201d. ","2601":"Notifications or responsibility of victims by LAPSUS$ are commonly reported via their telegram channel and in one case a victim\u2019s DNS records were reconfigured to LAPSUS$ controlled domains\/websites.","2602":"However, not all victims or breaches appear to actively be announced via their telegram channel, nor are some victims approached with a ransom.","2603":"This distinguishes themselves from more traditional ransomware groups who have a clear modus operandi and are clearly financially focused.","2604":"The result of this is that LAPSUS$ are less predictable which may be why they have seen recent success. ","2605":"This serves as a reminder for defenders for defence in depth and the need to anticipate different tactics that threat actors may use. ","2606":"It is also worth mentioning the brazen behaviour of this threat actor and their emboldened attempts at Social Engineering by offering payment for insiders to provide valid credentials. ","2607":"This tactic is potentially in response to greater home working due to the pandemic which means there is a far larger proportion of employees with VPN access and as such a greater pool of potential employees willing to sell their credentials. ","2608":"To combat this, organisations need to ensure they have extensive VPN logging capabilities, robust helpdesk ticketing as well as methods to help identify anomalies in VPN access. ","2609":"It is notable that the majority of LAPSUS$ actions exploit the human element as opposed to technical deficiencies or vulnerabilities.","2610":"Although potentially viewed as unsophisticated or basic these techniques have been successful, so it is vital that organisations factor in controls and mitigations to address them. ","2611":"Initial access Threat Intelligence shows that LAPSUS$ utilise multiple methods to gain Initial access. ","2612":"The main source of initial access is believed to occur via stolen authentication cookies which would grant the attacker access to a specific application.","2613":"These cookies are usually in the form of Single sign-on (SSO) applications which would allow the attacker to pivot into other corporate applications ultimately bypassing controls such as multi-factor authentication (MFA). ","2614":"Credential access and Privilege escalation Credential Harvesting and privileged escalation are key components of the LAPSUS$ breaches we have seen, with rapid escalation in privileges the LAPSUS$ group have been seen to elevate from a standard user account to an administrative user within a couple of days. ","2615":"In the investigations conducted by NCC Group, little to no malware is used.","2616":"In one case NCC Group observed LAPSUS$ using nothing more than the legitimate Sysinternals tool ADExplorer, which was used to conduct reconnaissance on the victim\u2019s environment. ","2617":"Access to corporate VPNs is a primary focus for this group as it allows the threat actor to directly access key infrastructure which they require to complete their objectives. ","2618":"In our incident response cases, we saw the threat actor leveraging compromised employee email accounts to email helpdesk systems requesting access credentials or support to get access to the corporate VPN. ","2619":"Lateral Movement In one incident LAPSUS$ were observed to sporadically move through the victim environment via RDP in an attempt to access resources deeper in the victim environment.","2620":"In some instances, victim controlled hostnames were revealed including the host \u201cVULTR-GUEST\u201d which refers to infrastructure hosted on the private cloud service, Vultr[3]. ","2621":"Exfiltration LAPSUS$\u2019s action on objectives appears to focus on data exfiltration of sensitive information as well as destruction or disruption.","2622":"In one particular incident the threat actor is observed to utilise the free file drop service \u201cfiletransfer[.]io\u201d. ","2623":"Impact NCC Group has observed disruption and destruction to client environments by LAPSUS$ such as shutting down virtual machines from within on-premises VMware ESXi infrastructure, to the extreme of mass deletion of virtual machines, storage, and configurations in cloud environments making it harder for the victim to recover and for the investigation team to conduct their analysis activities. ","2624":"The theft of data reported appears to heavily be focused on application source code or proprietary technical information.","2625":"With a targeting of internal source code management or repository servers.","2626":"These git repositories can contain not only commercially sensitive intellectual property, but also in some cases may include additional API keys to sensitive applications including administrative or cloud applications. ","2627":"Recommendations Ensure that Cloud computing environments have sufficient logging enabled.","2628":"Ensure that cloud administrative access is configured to prevent unauthorised access to resources and that API keys are not overly permissive to the permissions they require.","2629":"Utilise MFA for user authentication on both cloud and remote access solutions to help reduce the risk of unauthorised access.","2630":"Ensure logging is in place to record MFA device enrolmentSecurity controls such as Conditional Access can help restrict or prevent unauthorised access based on criteria such as geographical location.","2631":"Implement activities to detect and investigate anomalies in VPN access.","2632":"Ensure a system is in place to record all helpdesk queries.","2633":"Avoid using SMS as an MFA vector to avoid the risk of SIM swapping.","2634":"Securing source code environments to ensure that users can only access the relevant repositories.","2635":"Secret Scanning[1][2] on source code repositories should be conducted to ensure that sensitive API credentials are not stored in source code.","2636":"GitHub and Gitlab offer detection mechanisms for thisRemote Desktop services or Gateways used as a primary or secondary remote access solution should be removed from any corporate environment in favour for alternative solutions such as secured VPNs, or other Remote Desktop applications which mitigate common attack techniques such as brute force or exploitation and can offer additional security controls such as MFA and Conditional Access.","2637":"Centralise logging including cloud applications (SIEM solution).Offline or immutable backups of servers should be taken to ensure that in the event of a data disruption or destruction attack, services can be restored.","2638":"Reduce MFA token\/Session cookie validity timesEnsure principle of least privilege for user accounts is being adhered to.","2639":"Social engineering awareness training for all staff.

","2670":"Lateral Movement \u2013 Introduction Lateral movement refers to the tools and techniques used by attackers to progressively expand their foothold within an enterprise network after gaining initial access.","2671":"As shown in the figure below, lateral movement activity comprises of several stages starting from credential theft, target enumeration and discovery, privilege escalation, gaining access to network resources and eventually remote code execution on the target before exfiltrating data to accomplish a successful attack.","2672":"Once inside the network, attackers will deploy a range of techniques at each stage of lateral movement to achieve their end goal.","2673":"One of the primary challenges an attacker will face while moving laterally inside a network is to hide their activities in plain sight by generating a minimum volume of legitimate looking logs to be able to remain undetected.","2674":"To achieve this, an attacker might choose to embed the tool within a malicious executable or use the operating system\u2019s internal legitimate tools and services to perform its lateral movement operations, consequently making this network traffic harder to distinguish. ","2675":"As per the Verizon DBIR report 2020, over 80% of data breaches involve credential theft attacks.","2676":"Credential theft is one of the primary tasks attackers need to perform post-exploitation and after gaining initial control of the target machine.","2677":"It will usually be the first step towards lateral movement strategies which will allow attackers to elevate their privileges and acquire access to other network resources.","2678":"As indicated earlier, attackers have long been abusing Windows legitimate features like SMB, RPC over SMB, Windows Management Instrumentation, Windows Remote Management, and many other features to perform lateral movement activities.","2679":"Figure 1 below highlights where lateral movement falls within the attack chain and its different stages.","2680":"To remain stealthier, these activities would span a period ranging from many weeks to months. ","2681":"Figure 1 \u2013 Stages of Lateral movement To be able to distinguish between the admissible and malicious use of these inbuilt services, it is extremely critical for organizations to deploy advanced Threat Detection solutions.","2682":"Over the course of this blog, we will discuss various credential theft techniques used by adversaries during lateral movement.","2683":"We will also discuss an approach that can be used to effectively detect these techniques inside the network.

","3214":"Refresher on 8220 Gang 8220 Gang (pronounced eighty-two twenty), also known as 8220 Mining Group, was first publicly reported by Talos in 2018.","3215":"Victims of 8220 Gang are typically, but not exclusively, users of cloud networks operating vulnerable and misconfigured Linux applications and services. ","3216":"Attacks make use of SSH brute forcing post-infection to automate local and global spreading attempts.","3217":"Victims using cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP, Aliyun, QCloud) are often infected via publicly accessible hosts running Docker, Confluence, Apache WebLogic, and Redis.","3218":"Victims are not targeted geographically but simply identified by their internet accessibility. ","3219":"Initial Discovery Our walkthrough starts with the initial discovery of an interesting script found on a compromised AWS machine with publicly available SSH service secured with weak credentials.","3220":"For readers not running a honeypot, this initial discovery could have also been observed in the monitoring of new files uploaded to file scanning services like VirusTotal or MalShare.","3221":"For those looking to monitor this group, international SSH honeypots plus VirusTotal YARA rules offer a reliable method of catching new activity as it occurs. ","3222":"The script in question has the SHA1 a9da0947243333d95f84f6a0e37b9fc29b2fb054. 8220 Infection Script Snippet We can see it is quite simple in design and built around the process of downloading and setting persistence of some other file. ","3223":"With a few string pivots inside VT, or even a few Google searches, we can quickly discover the core functionality of the script has been widely reported on as it has been reused by many amateur cryptocurrency mining groups and opportunistic profit-seeking attackers.

","3229":"Infection Script createservices Function One difference that\u2019s quickly apparent to past reporting on the script is that the attacker began adding the lwp-download command as a failover for wget and curl to enable downloading commands.","3230":"We initially observed this activity on January 6th, and since then the actor has continued to standardize it in their infection scripts today.","3231":"Sysdig also noted this activity in a recent blog. ","3232":"Infection Script use of lwp-download The key take away from analyzing these infection scripts is noting unique additions, like lwp\u2013download, combined with the destination of download requests.","3233":"By clustering infection scripts based on function names and order, if the functions are called, and what infrastructure is associated, we can weed out the non-8220 Gang samples. ","3234":"Additionally, we can link this further based on the encoding quantity and repetition to past 8220 Gang samples.","3235":"For example, in our infection scripts createservices makes use of three base64 encoded echo commands.","3236":"The first command can be decoded into a new script which pings associated attacker infrastructure and then starts a \u201cpayload\u201d command.

","3250":"During our initial investigation in January, the group was using 185.106.94[.]146, and dw.bpdeliver[.]ru for malware download location post-infection such as in their infection script.","3251":"Anyone looking into this group should pivot on all subdomains associated with the actor-controlled domain, in addition to all DNS history of malicious IPs to identify a wider set of the malicious activity. ","3252":"For example, the recent dw.bpdeliver[.]ru host resolved to 79.137.203[.]156 during the initial deployment of the script.","3253":"More activity of 8220 Gang scripts can be found calling directly to this IP rather than the domain.","3254":"The same goes for 185.106.94[.]146, which is called by IP in the script, and which at the time resolved to jira.letmaker.top, a widely reported known 8220 Gang domain.

contacts\u2019 email addresses, and send spam emails.","3610":"VictimologyThe attacks predominantly target users in Mexico, with a few infections in Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, Guatemala and Panama.","3611":"In analyzing the phishing emails used in the campaign, Talos identified that users in organizations across several business verticals \u2014 including accounting, construction and engineering, wholesale distributing and investment firms \u2014 have been affected.","3612":"However, the attacker uses Horabot and the spam tool in this campaign to further propagate the attack by sending additional phishing emails to the victim\u2019s contacts, meaning Spanish-speaking users from organizations in additional verticals are likely also affected.","3613":"Attacker infrastructure dates back to Nov. 2020Talos discovered that the attacker in this campaign is using multiple hosts, including an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, accessed through its public URL, to host the malicious files.","3614":"During our analysis, Talos observed that a malicious server at IP address 185[.]45[.]195[.]226 hosted the PowerShell downloader script and had an open
