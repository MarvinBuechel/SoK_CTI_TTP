# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Experiments
This directory contains the experiments of the Named Entity Recognition pipeline for the *"SoK: Automated TTP Extraction from CTI Reports â€“ Are We There Yet?"* paper. We provide the following experiments:

## Ablation study (Table 5)
The aim is to find out to what extent the Named Entity Recognition pipeline performs if we remove given components.

We use the `ablation.sh` script to perform this experiment. This script calls the following three scripts in order:
1. `create_pipelines.sh` creates all NER pipelines used in the ablation study.
2. `run_pipelines.sh` runs all TRAM2 and Bosch AnnoCTR documents through all NER pipelines.
3. `evaluate_pipelines.sh` runs the evaluations against the ground truth.

The final results are stored in the `results` directory.
