top threat for all internet-connected businesses.","15":"These incidents have all the hallmarks of a ransomware-as-a-service attack, with crews \u201crenting\u201d software to launch the attack, hundreds of gigabytes in data stolen, and calls for million-dollar ransom payments.","16":"* In March 2021, the operator or operators behind the NEFILIM ransomware-as-a-service affiliate program claimed the compromise of U.S.-based commercial airline Spirit Airlines, leaking 40GB of data with over 33,000 files.","17":"[According to open source

Transportation Authority, stealing about 130 GB of corporate data.","19":"The responsible parties are likely an offshoot of those who developed the ransomware, as the organization\u2019s data was posted on a name-and-shame blog operated by a different criminal group.","20":"Keys to a successful business often rely on the internet, just as cybercriminals rely on it to carry out their crimes.","21":"Three ways ransomware-as-a-service has become easier than ever to launch","22":"A big reason why ransomware has grown into such a large cybersecurity problem is because it\u2019s easy for criminals to get involved.","23":"While money and geopolitics play big roles, there are some other means that have allowed ransomware infections to proliferate with little resistance.","24":"Each one covered below can be seen in ransomware attacks that have occurred this year, proving that the cybercrime underground is quick to utilize methods that will ultimately lead to the largest payouts possible.","25":"### Ransomware code gets reused","26":"Ransomware developers are fine-tuning the software to make it work as \u201cwell\u201d as it possibly can.","27":"One such example lies in Babuk, the RaaS variant that was released as \u201copen source\u201d at the end of April.","28":"After the builder was posted on the internet in June, it was discovered that it generates pairs of encryption and decryption tools targeting Microsoft Windows systems, VMWare ESXi hypervisors and network-attached storage (NAS) units from both Intel x86 and ARM architectures.","29":"Shortly thereafter lower-level actors took advantage of the builder, launching their own ransomware campaign outside of the Babuk affiliate program.","30":"In late June, an operator using info-stealing malware Vidar issued \u201cdownload and execute\u201d tasks to bots, aimed to install the Babuk ransomware variant generated by the builder.","31":"Another RaaS variant shows that malware code can be used interchangeably.","32":"Intel 471 has observed multiple similarities in the code between Conti ransomware and BazarLoader, malware that grants backdoor access to an infected Windows host.","33":"One particular similarity is in the code that allows Conti to evade analysis in an isolated instance, such as a sandbox or virtual machine.","34":"The code of this function is nearly identical to that used by the BazarLoader, with both functions following the exact logic and executing the same way when searching for hooks.","35":"While these examples are heavy on technical details, they essentially serve as building blocks for malware developers to easily build more efficient versions of ransomware, which in turn allow criminals to demand more money from ransomware victims.","36":"### Cybercriminals love those CVEs","37":"Cybercriminals pay attention to CVEs as much as anyone else, knowing that organizations drag their feet in closing vulnerabilities that give criminals the access they need to carry out attacks with little struggle.","38":"You can be sure that if you have read about a big vulnerability in the tech press, ransomware operators are aware of the news and will look to take advantage of it as soon as possible.","39":"For instance, Intel 471 has observed the FiveHands ransomware crew looking to utilize vulnerabilities like a [SonicWall buffer overflow vulnerability](https:\/\/threatpost.com\/sonicwall-botches-critical-vpn-bug\/167152\/) that wasn\u2019t patched correctly the first time it was uncovered, [a remote code execution vulnerability](https:\/\/us-cert.cisa.gov\/ncas\/current-activity\/2021\/07\/13\/vmware-releases-security-update) in VMware\u2019s vSphere Client that was pushed in May 2021, and the two vulnerabilities attached to Microsoft\u2019s [PrintNightmare problem](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/07\/07\/tech\/microsoft-security-update\/index.html) that are still causing issues for organizations across the world.","40":"We have not seen these vulnerabilities used in any attacks since being mentioned, but given the need to have access to the domain controller in order to launch a ransomware attack, it may not be long before the group leverages the vulnerability in order to lock an enterprise up for a hefty ransom.","41":"Ransomware attacks have evolved to go beyond attackers just locking up an organization\u2019s technology stack and hoping it finds a way to pay up.","42":"Now attackers are looking to cause more problems via double extortion attacks, name-and-shame blogs, or DDoS attacks directed toward any public-facing assets that haven\u2019t been locked up by the initial ransomware attack.","43":"In order for that to happen, RaaS gangs are working with other \u201cexperts\u201d in the cybercrime underground that specialize in various methods that can extend the life of a ransomware attack.","44":"Intel 471 observed one such actor working alongside the DarkSide ransomware gang until it shut down [following its attack on the Colonial Pipeline Co](https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2021\/06\/04\/politics\/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-password\/index.html).in the United States.","45":"The actor claimed to have launched DDoS attacks against DarkSide\u2019s victims for six weeks before the gang\u2019s shutdown.","46":"The actor also claimed that 10 to 20 targets were under DDoS at any given time, with attacks lasting from one to 21 days.","47":"Over a six month period, the person built enough reputation to latch onto one of the most notorious ransomware gangs in operation, profiting off the million-dollar ransoms DarkSide pulled in before disappearing.","48":"The instances highlighted above are not the sole reason for the rise of ransomware attacks in 2021.","49":"But attacks have moved far beyond sending a malicious link in an email and hoping for an errant click.","50":"Here\u2019s how information stealers pose a threat beyond ransomware","51":"Ransomware is a top threat that security teams should be tailoring their systems to defend against.","52":"But in order to do so, they may need to look further than the ransomware itself.","53":"And by widening that scope, these teams may protect their enterprise beyond the damage that ransomware can cause.","54":"The activity that Intel 471 analysts observe on the cybercrime underground has changed a bit with the rise of ransomware.","55":"Malware that has been used for traditional fraud schemes \u2014 particularly information stealers \u2014 has also been co-opted into the cycle of ransomware campaigns.","56":"While serving a reliable method for criminals to obtain credentials tied to financial accounts, they are now using information stealers to also go after corporate remote network login credentials, like virtual private networks (VPNs) or remote desktop software.","57":"Some versions may be solely dedicated to prying credentials away from your workforce, while others may give attackers modules that allow them to fine-tune their attack and possibly introduce longer-term attacks, like ransomware.","58":"* Intercept data entered into forms in the browser and send them to a malware control server (data exfiltration)","59":"* Install other

a relative novice or a veteran crew, account takeovers still present a solid revenue stream for anyone who wants to engage in illegal activities, as well as being the key enabler of ransomware attacks.","73":"Here's how to guard your enterprise against ShinyHunters","74":"Since surfacing in April 2020, the group \u2014 which refers to itself as ShinyHunters \u2014 has been behind some of the most notable data breaches that have been made public.","75":"Those include breaches of [Microsoft\u2019s GitHub

believes, with high confidence, that the Groove gang is associated with the Babuk gang, either as a former affiliate or subgroup.","114":"These cybercriminals are happy to put aside previous Ransomware-as-a-Service hierarchies to focus on the ill-gotten gains to be made from controlling victim\u2019s networks, rather than the previous approach which prioritized control of the ransomware itself.","115":"For many years the world of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) was perceived as a somewhat hierarchical and structured organization.","116":"Ransomware developers would advertise their RaaS program on forums and gracefully open up slots for affiliates to join their team to commit crime.","117":"The RaaS admins would conduct interviews with potential affiliates to make sure they were skilled enough to participate.","118":"Historically, i.e., with [CTB locker](https:\/\/www.mcafee.com\/blogs\/other-blogs\/mcafee-labs\/advanced-threat-research\/), the emphasis was on affiliates generating enough installs via a botnet, exploit kits or stolen credentials, but it has shifted in recent years to being able to penetrate and compromise a complete network using a variety of malicious and non-malicious tools.","119":"Recruitment posting for REvil from 2020","120":"While criminals collaborating in the world of cybercrime [isn\u2019t a new concept](https:\/\/research-information.bris.ac.uk\/ws\/portalfiles\/portal\/194364696\/DEVIANT\\_SECURITY\\_EHAVANDESANDT.pdf), a RaaS group\u2019s hierarchy is more rigid compared to other forms of cybercrime, due to the power imbalance between the group\u2019s developers\/admins and affiliates.","121":"For a long time, RaaS admins and developers were prioritized as the top targets, often neglecting the affiliates since they were perceived as less-skilled.","122":"This, combined with the lack of disruptions in the RaaS ecosystem, created an atmosphere where those lesser-skilled affiliates could thrive and grow into very competent cybercriminals.","123":"Recently we have observed certain events that might be the beginning of a new chapter in the RaaS ecosystem.","124":"### Cracks in the RaaS model","125":"Ransomware has been generating billions of dollars in recent years and with revenue like that, it\u2019s only a matter of time before some individuals who believe they aren\u2019t getting their fair share become unhappy.","126":"Recently, a former Conti affiliate was unhappy with their financial portion and decided to disclose the complete Conti attack playbook and their Cobalt Strike infrastructure online, as shown in the screenshot below.","127":"Disgruntled Conti affiliate","128":"In the past, ATR has been approached by individuals affiliated with certain RaaS groups expressing grudges with other RaaS members and admins, claiming they haven't been paid in time or that their share wasn't proportionate to the amount of work they put in.","129":"Recently, security researcher [Fabian Wosar](https:\/\/twitter.com\/fwosar\/status\/1433050105872109576) opened a dedicated Jabber account for disgruntled cybercriminals to reach out anonymously and he stated that there was a high level of response.","130":"Jabber group for unhappy threat actors","131":"Moreover, the popular cybercrime forums have banned ransomware actors from advertising since the Colonial Pipeline attack.","132":"The lack of visibility has made it harder for RaaS groups to establish or maintain credibility and will make it harder for RaaS developers to maintain their current top tier position in the underground.","133":"After a turbulent shutdown of Babuk and the fallout from the Colonial Pipeline and Kaseya attacks, it seems that some of the ransomware-affiliated cybercriminals have found a home in a forum known as RAMP.","134":"A RAMP post authored by Orange, introducing Groove and explaining relationships","135":"> GROOVE \u2014 I\u2019ve never revealed its name before and it\u2019s never been mentioned directly in the media, but it does exist \u2014 we\u2019re like Mossad (we are few and aren\u2019t hiring).","136":"It\u2019s Groove whom the babuk ransomware needs to thank for its fame.","137":"> Groove rocks, and babuk stinks :)","138":"> Challenge: Using a PHP stack+MYSQL+Bootstrap, code a standard ransomware operators\u2019 blog in THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE with the following pages:","139":"> Use standard display, just like other ransomware operators\u2019 blogs do.","140":"> 2) Groove has never had a ransomware product, nor will that ever change.","141":"> 3) The babuk team doesn\u2019t exist.","142":"We rented the ransomware from a coder who could not shoulder the responsibility, got too scared and decided to leave an error in the ESX builder \u2014 naturally, to give us a reason to chuck him out (his motives.Fxxx if I know)","143":"> babuk 2.0, which hit the headlines, is not to be taken seriously and must be regarded as nothing but a very stupid joke","144":"This actor claimed the forum would specifically cater to other ransomware-related threat actors after they were ousted from major cybercrime forums for being too toxic, following the high-profile ransomware attacks against the Colonial Pipeline and Washington D.C.\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department in the spring of 2021.","145":"At the time of the initial launch, Orange claimed the forum's name was a tribute to a now-defunct Russian-language underground drug marketplace, \u201cRussian Anonymous Marketplace,\u201d which was taken down by Russian law enforcement agencies in 2017.","146":"The forum was initially launched on the same TOR-based resource that previously hosted a name-and-shame blog operated by the Babuk ransomware gang and the Payload.bin marketplace of leaked corporate data.","147":"We found a posting from where the names Orange and Darkside are mentioned as potential monikers.","148":"Based on ATR's previous research, we believe the name Orange was chosen as a tribute to REvil\/GandCrab.","149":"However, there was a less well known REvil affiliate admin named Orange.","150":"A tribute seems fitting here as these successful ransomware families, GandCrab and REvil, shaped the RaaS ecosystem as we know it today.","151":"However, REvil insiders will recognize the name Orange as one of their admins.","152":"Based on ATR\u2019s closed-source underground research, we believe with a high level of confidence, that UNKN was indeed linked to the aforementioned accounts, as well as the infamous \u201cCrab\u201d handle used by GandCrab.","153":"Crab was one of the two affiliate-facing accounts that the GandCrab team had (The other being Funnycrab).","154":"We believe with a high level of confidence that after the closure of GandCrab, the individual behind the Funnycrab account changed to the account name to Orange and continued operations with REvil, with only a subset of skilled GandCrab affiliates, (as described in this Virus Bulletin 2019 [whitepaper](https:\/\/www.virusbulletin.com\/blog\/2019\/11\/vb2019-paper-different-ways-cook-crab-gandcrab-ransomware-service-raas-analysed-depth\/)) since GandCrab grew too big and needed to shed some weight.","155":"### Groove Gang","156":"Additionally, the actor claims that the name has not been mentioned in the media before, comparing the group to the Israeli secret service group Mossad.","157":"The group\u2019s comparison to Mossad is extremely doubtful at best, given the drama that has publicly played out.","158":"Groove claims several of Babuk\u2019s victims, including the Metropolitan Police Department, brought them a lot of attention.","159":"The several mentions to Babuk isn\u2019t by mistake: we have evidence the two groups also have connections, which we\u2019ve pieced together from examining the behavior of \u2014 and particularly the fallout between \u2014 the two groups.","160":"Originally, the Babuk gang paid affiliates by each victim they attacked.","161":"Instead, their focus shifted to data exfiltration and extortion of targeted organizations.","162":"That was followed by the group [releasing](https:\/\/www.bleepingcomputer.com\/news\/security\/babuk-ransomware-is-back-uses-new-version-on-corporate-networks\/) the builder for the old versions of its ransomware as it pivoted to a new one for themselves.","163":"The attention that Babuk drew by hacking and extorting the Metropolitan Police Department meant their brand name became widely known.","164":"Then, on Sept. 3, the threat actor with the handle \u2018dyadka0220\u2019 stated that they were the principal developer of Babuk ransomware and posted what they claimed was the Babuk ransomware source code.","165":"On Sept. 7, the Groove gang responded with a blog on their own website, titled \u201cThoughts about the meaning,\u201d which rhymes in Russian.","166":"Additionally, their response alleges that the Groove gang never created the Babuk ransomware themselves, but worked with someone else to produce it.","167":"The validity of the claims in Groove\u2019s latest blog is hard to determine, although this does not matter too much: the Babuk group, including affiliates, had a fallout that caused the group to break up, causing the retaliation of several (ex-)members.","168":"The ATR team has covered Babuk multiple times.","169":"The [second](https:\/\/www.mcafee.com\/blogs\/other-blogs\/mcafee-labs\/babuk-biting-off-more-than-they-could-chew-by-aiming-to-encrypt-vm-and-nix-systems\/) blog, published last July, dives into the ESXi version of the ransomware and its issues.","170":"The group\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are in-line with commonly observed techniques from ransomware actors.","171":"Together with other vendors we have narrowed down some of the TTPs observed by the Groove gang.","172":"### Initial Access","173":"The access can be bought, in terms of stolen (yet valid) credentials, or direct access in the form of a live backdoor on one or more of the victim\u2019s systems.","174":"Alternatively, the actor can exploit publicly facing infrastructure using a known or unknown exploit.","175":"To ATR\u2019s understanding, the latter has been used several times by exploiting vulnerable VPN servers.","176":"### Lateral Movement, Discovery and Privilege Escalation","177":"Moving around within the network is an important step for the actor, for two reasons.","178":"Firstly, it allows the attacker to find as much data as possible, which is then exfiltrated.","179":"Secondly, access to all machines is required in order to deploy the ransomware at a later stage.","180":"By encrypting numerous devices at once, it becomes even harder to control the damage from a defender\u2019s point of view.","181":"The actor uses commonly known tools, such as [Ad-Find](https:\/\/www.joeware.net\/freetools\/tools\/adfind\/) and [NetScan](https:\/\/www.netscantools.com\/index.html), to gather information on the network.","182":"Based on the gathered information, the actor will move laterally through the network.","183":"One of the most frequently observed methods by this actor to do so, is by using RDP.","184":"To work with more than user-level privileges, the actor has a variety of options to escalate their privilege to a domain administrator.","185":"Brute forcing RDP accounts, the dumping of credentials, and the use of *legacy* exploits such as EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144), are ways to quickly obtain access to one or more privileged accounts.","186":"### Data Exfiltration and Ransomware Deployment","187":"The actor navigates through the machines on the network using the earlier obtained access.","188":"To exfiltrate the collected data, the attacker uses [WinSCP](https:\/\/winscp.net\/eng\/index.php).","189":"Once all relevant data has been stolen, the attacker will execute the ransomware in bulk.","190":"This can be done in a variety of ways, ranging from manually starting the ransomware on the targeted machines, scheduling a task per machine, or using [PsExec](https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/downloads\/psexec) to launch the ransomware.","191":"### Linking Groove to Babuk and BlackMatter","192":"As discussed above, there was a fallout within Babuk.","193":"From that fallout, a part of the group stayed together to form Groove.","194":"The server that Babuk used, which we will refer to as the \u201cwyyad\u201d server due to the ending of the onion URL, rebranded in late August 2021.","195":"The changes to the landing page from Babuk to Groove","196":"Aside from this, data from old Babuk victims is still hosted on this

shop.","202":"All these victims have previously been claimed by (and attributed to) Babuk.","203":"Another gang, known as BlackMatter, uses a variety of locations to host their extorted files, which can be done out of convenience or to avoid a single notice and takedown to remove all offending files.","204":"The data of one of the BlackMatter gang\u2019s victims, a Thai IT service provider, is stored on the \u201cwyyad\u201d server.","205":"As such, it can mean that the Groove gang worked as an affiliate for the BlackMatter gang.","206":"The image below shows the BlackMatter leak website linking to the \u201cwyyad\u201d server.","207":"Screenshot of BlackMatter, where the data is stored on the Groove server","208":"The Groove gang\u2019s website contains, at the time of writing, a single leak: data from a German printing company.","209":"Another Groove victim but stored on their own page","210":"The affected company does not meet BlackMatter\u2019s \u201crequirements,\u201d the group has said it only goes after companies that make more than $US 100 million.","211":"Posting on the Exploit forum by BlackMatter","212":"The group\u2019s primary goal, making money, is not limited to ransomware.","213":"Inversely, ransomware would be the cherry on top.","214":"This is yet another indication of the ransomware group\u2019s shift to a less hierarchical set-up and a more fluid and opportunistic network-based way of working.","215":"In the Groove Gang\u2019s blog on September 7, a reference is made with regards to BlackMatter, and its links to DarkSide.","216":"If true, these insights show that the Groove gang has insider knowledge of the BlackMatter gang.","217":"This makes the collaboration between Groove and BlackMatter more likely.","218":"If these claims are false, it makes one wonder as to why the Groove gang felt the need to talk about other gangs, since they seem to want to make a name for themselves.","219":"Due to the above outlined actions ATR believes, with high confidence, that Groove is a former affiliate or subgroup of the Babuk gang, who are willing to collaborate with other parties, as long as there's financial gain for them.","220":"Thus, an affiliation with the BlackMatter gang is likely.","221":"Ever since Ransomware-as-a-Service became a viable, and highly profitable, business model for cybercriminals, it has operated in much the same way with affiliates being the sometimes underpaid workhorses at the bottom of a rigid pyramid shaped hierarchy.","222":"For some affiliates there was an opportunity to become competent cybercriminals while, for many others, the lack of recompense and appreciation for their efforts led to ill-feeling.","223":"Combined with underground forums banning ransomware actors, this created the perfect opportunity for the threat actor known as Orange to emerge, with the Groove gang in tow, with the offer of new ways of working where an associate\u2019s worth was based entirely on their ability to earn money.","224":"Time will tell if this approach enhances the reputation of the Groove gang to the level of the cybercriminals they seem to admire.","225":"One thing is clear though; with the manifestation of more self-reliant cybercrime groups the power balance within the RaaS ecosystem will change from he who controls the ransomware to he who controls the victim's networks.","226":"We have compiled a list of TTPs based on older Babuk cases and some recent cases linked to Groove:","227":"* T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application (VPN services)","228":"* T1003: OS Credential Dumping","229":"* T1078.002: Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts","230":"* T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter","231":"* T1021:002: SMB\/Windows Admin Shares","232":"* T1210: Exploitation of Remote

groups have plagued organizations across different industry vectors.","242":"From January 2021 to August 2021, we observed about 50 possible breach events for international government, national and regional governments that were ransomware-related, with about half of those incidents tied to RaaS programs.","243":"Below is a graph that tallies the attacks and the RaaS affiliates tied to them:","244":"The most attack of the measured time period was the DarkSide ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline in May 2021.","245":"As a result of the attention gained from this event, Intel 471 observed RaaS groups adjust their operations, which included new regulations on operators or affiliates targeting government entities.","246":"Operators of several RaaS programs retreated from additional public focus, opting to maintain a low profile and prohibited their affiliates from targeting government organizations.","247":"These changes were short lived: by June 2021 the REvil RaaS operators lifted previous bans and promised additional benefits to affiliates who were willing to attack any U.S.-based company or organization, which likely included government entities.","248":"Additionally, we observed increased sophistication in phishing pages over the same time period.","249":"Intel 471 has observed three particular vulnerability types used as initial access vectors to compromise public sector networks: remote code execution (RCE), structured query language-injection (SQLi) and cross-site scripting (XSS).","250":"These methods, which were used to gain initial access, were observed in breach events conducted by individual threat actors and RaaS operators.","251":"In March 2021, an Italian-linked actor claimed on a popular cybercrime forum that they obtained access to a VMware ESXi cloud virtualization server that would grant someone access to municipalities in Eastern Europe.","252":"In April 2021, we observed another actor offer to sell information about an SQLi vulnerability allegedly impacting resources belonging to a U.S.-based government entity in Colorado.","253":"Also in April, an actor was advertising a compromised database stolen from a city in Turkey, allegedly containing about 1 million records including names, passwords, permissions, phone numbers, user IDs and usernames.","254":"Government entities at all levels should remain vigilant in order to defend against the aforementioned threats as cybercriminals continue to improve and refine their TTPs.","255":"Users also can monitor for compromised credentials proactively via Intel 471's Credential Intelligence service, track weaponized malware via our Malware Intelligence and determine patch prioritization of vulnerabilities via our Vulnerability Dashboard.","256":"These companies operate air, ground and maritime cargo transport on several continents that are responsible for moving billions of dollars worth of goods around the world.","257":"These actors have obtained these credentials by leveraging well-known vulnerabilities in remote access solutions like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), VPN, Citrix, and SonicWall, among others.","258":"The new actor included the company\u2019s credentials in a dump of approximately 50 companies, allegedly all obtained via compromised Citrix, Cisco, virtual private network (VPN) and\/or remote desktop protocol (RDP) accounts.","259":"* **In August 2021**, one actor known to work with groups that have deployed Conti ransomware claimed access to corporate networks belonging to a U.S.-based transportation management and trucking software supplier and a U.S.-based commodity transportation services company.","260":"The actor gave the group access to an undisclosed botnet powered by malware that included a virtual network computing (VNC) function.","261":"The group used the botnet to download and execute a Cobalt Strike beacon on infected machines, so group members in charge of breaching computer networks received access directly via a Cobalt Strike beacon session.","262":"* **In September 2021**, an actor with ties to the FiveHands ransomware group claimed access to hundreds of companies, including a U.K.-based logistics company.","263":"It\u2019s most likely that access was obtained through a SonicWall vulnerability, given that FiveHands is known to use that access to [launch its ransomware attacks](https:\/\/www.bleepingcomputer.com\/news\/security\/new-ransomware-group-uses-sonicwall-zero-day-to-breach-networks\/).","264":"Additionally in September, a new actor claimed to have gained access to a Bangladesh-based shipping and logistics company through a vulnerability in the PulseSecure VPN.","265":"The actor claimed he obtained the credentials through a path traversal vulnerability in Fortinet\u2019s FortiGate secure sockets layer (SSL) VPN web portal (CVE-2018-13379).","266":"The NotPetya attack in 2017 devastated Danish shipping and maritime giant Maersk, [shutting down several of its ports](https:\/\/losangeles.cbslocal.com\/2017\/06\/28\/la-port-terminal-still-closed\/) and costing the company $300 million to replace systems

differs from previous versions","270":"Last month, Intel 471 observed the emergence of Emotet, a notorious strain of malware that had been dormant for most of 2021 after law enforcement agencies [forced it offline](https:\/\/intel471.com\/blog\/emotet-takedown-2021).","271":"We wrote in January that \u201cOnly time will tell if the takedown will have a long-term impact on Emotet operations.","272":"While it took months to do, it looks like those behind Emotet have recovered.","273":"However, given further examination, we have found distinct differences, including the encryption used for communication, additional commands and reconfigurations in several pieces of the communication protocol.","274":"Further investigation into Emotet\u2019s keys and IP buffers also revealed two separate botnets are being used to distribute the malware.","275":"Emotet is a loader-focused, modular malware family that can steal credentials and emails, while also allowing users to send spam from infected users.","276":"* A SPAM module","277":"* Email credential stealer","278":"* Outlook email address harvester","279":"* Browser credential stealer","280":"* Web-injector","281":"* A module that allowed for brute-forcing credentials and lateral movement","282":"In the short time that the malware has been active, Emotet has been heavily used to push malspam.","283":"While Intel 471 Malware Intelligence systems were unable to collect any malspam from Emotet, open source intelligence (OSINT) spam samples pulled from various sources, including the VirusTotal intelligence platform, demonstrate the spam templates used.","284":"Emotet emails are fairly simple, consisting of an attached compressed (.zip) file and password used to open the file.","285":"The image depicts an Emotet email lure.","286":"The encrypted .zip file contained a malicious Microsoft Word document (maldoc) used to download and install the Emotet loader.","287":"Upon opening Emotet maldocs, victims are greeted with fake Microsoft 365 prompt that states \u201cTHIS DOCUMENT IS PROTECTED,\u201d and instructs victims on how to enable macros.","288":"The image depicts an Emotet document lure.","289":"Enabling macros will allow the document to spawn PowerShell and attempt to download and execute the Emotet loader.","290":"The document uses at least five different distribution lures typically to ensure reliability and uptime for loader distribution.","291":"The document uses the following commands to spawn PowerShell and attempt to download and execute the malware:","292":"Defenders should look for Microsoft Word or Excel sheets that spawn `CMD -> PowerShell -> rundll32[.]exe` to identify Emotet activity.","293":"Many parts of the bot are identical to the version of Emotet that was active prior to the takedown, particularly the dynamic-link library (DLL).","294":"Emotet depends on `rundll32[.]exe` to execute, using the exported function \u201cControl\\\\_RunDLL\u201d as the main starting function.","295":"While the loader uses a fairly intensive code flattening\/state machine obfuscator, YARA rules created from a few key Emotet algorithms indicate the loader is based on code dated from December 2020 to January 2021.","296":"Despite previous versions of code being recycled, there are differences in the loader that set it apart from Emotet\u2019s past.","297":"The old Emotet used an onboard public Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) key to encrypt the advanced encryption standard (AES) key used to encrypt all network traffic, as is typical for asymmetric encryption.","298":"This public key also is used during communication validation by hashing the data to check that it has not been modified.","299":"The new Emotet uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for asymmetric encryption, leveraging an onboard elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) public key for encryption and an onboard elliptic-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) public key for data validation.","300":"These encryption keys are used to identify the Emotet botnets researchers are calling Epoch4 and Epoch5.","301":"In addition to the changes to Emotet\u2019s cryptography, the communication protocol also saw some changes to each of the three \u201clayers\u201d necessary for communication.","302":"Layer 1 (L1) contains the plaintext data sent to the command and control (C2).","303":"Layer 2 (L2) contains the client command operation code (opcode) sent by the victim and a SHA-256 hash of L1.","304":"Layer 3 (L3) is the encrypted data and contains the encrypted AES key, the encrypted data and some randomly generated data as padding.","305":"The old Emotet also used a multilayer communication protocol for all communication performed by the infected victim and the C2.","306":"However, the old protocol required the loader to also enumerate the victim\u2019s process list, which was sent to the C2 during check-in.","307":"New Emotet strips out this process checking functionality from initial check-in and places it into a new module focused on process list checking.","308":"The following structure was observed for the new Emotet initial check-in:","309":"A new addition to the Emotet protocol requirements and Emotet module list, the process checking module is sent to the bot after the C2 receives the bot\u2019s initial check-in.","310":"This module exclusively grabs the infected victim\u2019s process list, which is sent back to the C2 using the following L1:","311":"Emotet no longer delivers any modules until the process list module has been received successfully and the C2 has received the process list from the bot.","312":"Additionally, the module\\\\_id and module\\\\_job\\\\_id no longer are stored inside the module itself, but instead are stored in the command buffer received from the C2.","313":"L2 for Emotet\u2019s communication protocol adds the client command opcode and a SHA-256 hash of the L1 data.","314":"L3 for Emotet\u2019s communication protocol contains the encrypted L2, the ECC key used to encrypt L2 and some randomly generated data that serves as padding.","315":"The randomly generated data has some interesting formatting performed on it that first replaces all nulls with `0xC3`.","316":"In addition to protocol changes, Intel 471 analysts also observed changes to the new Emotet command table.","317":"| 2 | Load Module | Injects a module into memory.","318":"| 3 | Execute EXE | Drops and executes executable.","319":"| 4 | Execute EXE as user | Drops and executes executable as a specific user.","320":"| 5 | Inject DLL with export | Injects a DLL into memory and maps and executes the export DllRegisterServer.","321":"| 6 | Execute dll with `regsvr32[.]exe` | Drops and executes DLL with `\u201cregsvr32[.]exe -s .\u201d`","322":"| 7 | Execute dll with `rundll32[.]exe` | Drops and executes DLL with `\u201crundll32[.]exe , Control\\_RunDLL.\u201d`","323":"The update to the loader\u2019s command table gives Emotet much more customizable execution options, allowing Emotet to better function as a loader-focused distribution family.","324":"In the course of investigating the code, Intel 471 found two new distinct Emotet botnets.","325":"Additionally, prior to Emotet\u2019s takedown, it had the following distinct botnets:","326":"As Emotet is a multistage infection, there are many opportunities for defenders to catch it during operation.","327":"During the email\/maldoc stage, one such method for detection is user awareness regarding the lure template Emotet uses.","328":"The red box template in Image 2 is standard for Emotet documents.","329":"If that fails, defenders can look for instances where PowerShell is spawned from Microsoft Word or Excel sheets and subsequently opens `rundll32[.]exe` to execute a DLL.","330":"While Emotet typically uses the export \u201cControl\\\\_RunDLL,\u201d looking for instances that do not use that export still would be a good idea, since this behavior is unusual in non-malicious settings.","331":"As Emotet creates both a run key and a service during install, defenders can watch for any suspicious services created, especially if the process the service launched originates from `%LOCALAPPDATA%`.","332":"Additionally, during various command executions, defenders can look for the following command lines to detect Emotet when it executes binaries.","333":"However, Emotet will have installed at this point and a full investigation will be needed:","334":"* `Regsvr32[.]exe -s `","335":"* `Rundll32[.]exe , Control\\_RunDLL`","336":"Recently, a malware dropper received by mail has caught our attention as we have detected different samples sent to multiple targets in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Norway, although it has probably reached many more European countries.","337":"Firstly, it is characteristic that it lands on the victim in PPT format, while it has been much more common to find DOC or XLS extensions being used for this purpose.","338":"The document has no content, but when you close the PPT viewer, the following window shows up:","339":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1.png)","340":"This window is generated by the macros contained in the On\\_Close function, which is executed when you close the document, instead of when oppened, thus preventing macros from being executed in many sandbox solutions.","341":"This macro have the following slightly obfuscated code:","342":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2.png)","343":"If we look at the content of those two variables, we can see that they contain the following string: \u201cmshta.exe https:\/\/j.]mp\/kasasjdoopoopasdskdd\u201d, which causes the legitimate Windows interpreter \u201cmshta\u201d to execute a script hosted on the web that follows.","344":"In fact, this

\u201cnotepad.exe\u201d and the variable that contains the third executable.","363":"This second binary just loaded, after being analyzed in the same way as the AMSI Bypass DLL, is used to inject in a **non** .Net executable inside another process that is not .Net either.","364":"That is, it creates a legitimate notepad process, and injects into it the third binary it has downloaded.","365":"This last binary, consists of a sample of the Bot\/Stealer LokiBot, practically unpacked, which at this point, is in a system without most of its protection measures.","366":"It is interesting that, up to

on stealing credentials from all types of mail clients, FTP, browsers and many other services, it also acts as a bot, allowing some control over the computer by the actor behind this threat.","368":"Updates on OwlProxy malware","369":"During the analysis of some malicious artifacts collected from an incident, we have recently detected a sample that has caught our attention, the sample was deployed on a server exposed to the Internet and was packed with \u201cVMProtect\u201d.","370":"After analyzing this malware sample we could see that it was a recent version of a tool known as OwlProxy, which has been detected on targets hit by the APT group known as Chimera.","371":"The use of \u201cVMProtect\u201d by the actors makes the analysis of their code more time-consuming (although it simplifies its detection since this is already an anomaly by itself).","372":"On the other hand, this packer has some weaknesses such as the fact that it does not always protect part of the binary metadata and that once in memory, it does not obfuscate most of the strings, which makes these elements of the executable relatively easy to analyze once in memory.","373":"From some of these strings, it can be seen how new samples are being uploaded regularly, which after a more detailed analysis have been identified as different 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the same threat, some of them packaged and others not.","374":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/asd2-1024x308.png)","375":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/asd3.png)","376":"A summary of its capabilities can be found in this report, which explains that it acts as a proxy between the DMZ of the victim\u2019s infrastructure and its internal network and also allows the execution of commands remotely.","377":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/asd4.png)","378":"In the case of the samples analyzed, instead of using port 80, they are exposing the port 443 using SSL and they have stopped using the string \u201cservlet\u201d and now they have different strings depending on the sample in question, they have kept the string \u201cpp\u201d for the endpoint that acts as proxy.","379":"Two of them are newer versions of this same 32-bit and 64-bit tool and the third one is an installer or dropper (9A9FFDB8FC20B6E6E6E5A1DE434F6B834E69755FD62157F91884E9A681F0073256) that when executed, depending on the operating system architecture, extracts from its resources a suitable OwlProxy sample for the architecture in question, installs it in system32 with the name \u201cwmipd.dll\u201d, gives it the same creation and modification date as \u201ccalc.exe\u201d and creates a service named wmipd that runs it at every system startup.","380":"The pdb of this dropper keeps the string \u201cowl\u201d in its path, so we have named it OwlInstaller.","381":"The OwlProxy sample of its resources is split into reverse ordered blocks, so the MZ header, for example, is in the last 2634 bytes of the file.","382":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/asd5.png)","383":"Along with the fact that these also use \u201chttps\u201d as protocol, and that they have again changed part of the path of their endpoints to use \u201cexchangetopicservices\u201d (probable evolution of the 2019 samples that use the string \u201ctopics\u201d), they have added a new endpoint to the tool, as follows:","384":"| https:\/\/+:443\/exchangetopicservices\/px\/ | Webshell

actors might be trying to take their move.","396":"Several campaigns aimed to Colombia have been detected, but today we will talk about one with a couple interesting details in their kill chain.","397":"This actor is starting the infection via email with very generic topics such as subpoenas or bank payments, with a crafted html view where the icon pretending to be an attachment is in fact an image with a link to download a compressed file from One Drive.","398":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/phichin-1024x506.png)Phishing emails serving same malicious

execute a new Powershell script by executing the following command:","400":"The interesting fact about this first stage is that this element is being downloaded from The Internet Archive, where you can take snapshots of websites, or upload \u201cantique\u201d files, so they keep being accessible after the website disappears from the ordinary internet at their original hosting site.","401":"We are starting to witness how attackers are using legitimate domains such as discord or twitter, to download some malicious payload, or even legitimate cloud services such as One Drive or DropBox to host different samples.","402":"However, using The Internet Archive could be considered witty, and not-so-much seen in the wild so far.","403":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screenshot-from-2021-05-13-16-46-32-1.png)","404":"*Opendir in The Internet Archive*","405":"Basically, this Powershell script

content into respective files, we could identify two Dynamic Libraries written in .NET, one of them used as a loader for the other, which happens to be the final malicious Remote Access Trojan (RAT).","410":"According to [360 Total Security researchers](https:\/\/blog.360totalsecurity.com\/en\/new-infection-chain-of-njrat-variant\/), some similar techniques were spotted loading a Delphi version of the njRAT in July 2020, by what it seemed to be an Arabic speaker actor.","411":"Even though in both cases the binary files have resulted in Dynamic Libraries and same loading technique, in this occasion both binaries were identified as written in .NET. Furthermore, the RAT used in this scenario was Lime-RAT, a modified version of njRAT.","412":"When taking a closer look at the final stage in order to identify the final Command and Control server, we found another interesting element.","413":"This actor chose the domain \u201csantiagonasar.]duckdns.org\u201d, which is actually the name of the main character of Chronicle of a Death Foretold

different stages, suggesting that this could be an individual going by this nickname, it is worth mentioning the fact that the APT group referred as APT-C-36, or Blind Eagle, have been spotted many times using this same toolset including LimeRAT, targeting same geographic area through phishing emails written in perfect Spanish, and also using Duckdns as part of their infrastructure.","415":"After a quick research on previous DNS resolutions of the final C2, we could identify related documents contacting the same IP, referring to Colombia and the use of the word \u201cCacha\u201d, which could be a way of saying \u201cfriend\u201d or \u201cbrother\u201d in Colombia, among other meanings in Spanish.","416":"These relations, added to the Spanish literary

after another quick search on different binary executables contacting this same C2, we found different forms of packed malware samples using strings in Asian and Cyrillic encoding, with a noisier obfuscation.","420":"The cached analysis in shodan.io would also show that the server might only have one port open at a time, which would support the idea of the attacker rotating ports for every campaign while reusing same C2 infrastructure.","421":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screenshot-from-2021-05-17-12-47-44.png)","422":"C2 check in shodan.io","423":"Quick review of Babuk ransomware builder","424":"Last week, the builder for the Babuk ransomware family was leaked online.","425":"Lab52 has obtained and analyzed this builder sample determining that it is

take the content of note.txt and use it as the ransomware note that it would be dropped in the infected machines.","442":"Since Babuk decided not to use any packing mechanism, we could also spot in clear text the ransom note and the rest of the space reserved for the ransomware note inside the built binaries.","443":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/09.png) Strings of

executable, and we found out that we could pass as a second argument an actual eliptic curve encyption key, instead of letting the builder generate it for us, allowing the ransomware operator to use the same decryption executable for different builds.","446":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/11-Copy-1024x729.png)","447":"Argument parsing of Babuk

these files and a deep knowledge about them, could have written this builder.","451":"This could be considered important since new ransomware gangs could try to take advantage of this leak for their own Raas \u201cstartup\u201d.","452":"However, it is also valuable for researchers since it will allow us to generate better detection rules, or even track new unofficial variations of the ransomware family.","453":"TokyoX: DLL side-loading an unknown artifact","454":"During Christmas holidays, Lab52 has been analyzing a sample which loads an artifact that we have decided to refer to as \u201cTokyoX\u201d since no similarities have been found as to any known malware, which we usually detect in open sources.","455":"(382b3d3bb1be4f14dbc1e82a34946a52795288867ed86c6c43e4f981729be4fc) which had the following timestamps in VirusTotal at the time of the current analysis, and was uploaded from Russia via web site:","456":"Some antivirus engines tagged the sample as PlugX, but it seems that the attribution might be due to the final payload\u2019s loading mechanism: DLL sideloading with an encrypted payload in the same directory.","457":"After analyzing the final payload we could not find any similarities with other known samples from PlugX other than the loading TTPs.","458":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/00.png)","459":"The legitimate file Creative.exe, an encrypted Data file and the version.dll DLL, which implements the loader function for the Data file, and therefore responsible of mapping the \u201cTokyoX\u201d.","460":"If we execute it from a path which is not final or the expected by the malware, it replicates to another path and executes from there, which is something it does have in common with some PlugX dll loaders:","461":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/01.png)","462":"Once executed, we observe how the netsh.exe process tries to establish connections with port 443 of the IP address 31.192.107[.]187.","463":"In this analysis we will focus on different aspects about the process; from double-clicking the binary 123.exe process (which is a copy of Creative.exe but in another path) to the execution of \u201cTokyoX\u201d already decrypted in memory.","464":"The first thing we observe within the process is how the version.dll library prepares the decryption and the final payload\u2019s loading in the remote process:","465":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/02-1024x387.png)","466":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/03.png)","467":"After reading the file from disk, a child process netsh.exe is created.","468":"This just-created child process is where several new memory segments will be located (a total of 5, including the final decrypted payload) to decrypt the final \u201cTokyoX\u201d payload.","469":"First, it creates two segments: 100Kb where the encrypted payload is located and which comes from the disc, and another one of 4Kb. In the 4Kb segment we observe how the following string is set (which will be the string used for the decrypting process):","470":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/04-1024x292.png)","471":"The other memory segment of 100Kb contains the following (encrypted content, as we see how it matches the content from Data file on Disk):","472":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/05-1024x784.png)","473":"After the creation of these two segments, a third segment is allocated, where it is loaded the absolute memory addresses from several win32 APIs (VirtualAlloc, LoadLibrary, GetProcAddress, the home address of the coded payload, etc.for its later use by the loader:","474":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/06.png)","475":"We can notice how the segment will have the memory addresses (starting from 123.exe they are located in netsh.exe segment through the version.dll code):","476":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/07-1024x131.png)","477":"Then, another segment of 4Kb is created where it loads the code that will decrypt and load the final payload.","478":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/08.png)","479":"Finally, the \u201cTokyoX\u201d loader runs from the DLL (version.dll) in netsh.exe through the API NtcreateThreadEx and we see the start of the last page created in the stack:","480":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/09-1024x476.png)","481":"After the execution of NtCreateThreadEx, as indicated, the loader is initiated in netsh.exe in the segment:","482":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/10.png)","483":"Once the execution is moved to the netsh.exe process, it takes the string located in the initial 4Kb segment, copies it into the stack and replicates it (0x100, 256 bytes) to match the specific block size of 256bytes.","484":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/11.png)","485":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/12.png)","486":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/13.png)","487":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/14.png)","488":"The combination of the blue block (in following image) and the 00-FF block (pointed in red in previous image) results in the following block in memory, marked in red in the image:","489":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/15.png)","490":"On the next step, the loader reads the initial argument, arg0, whose value is 0x900000 and points at the 4Kb block, which stores the absolute addresses to different API from Win32:","491":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/16.png)","492":"After this, the decrypting process for the final payload begins.","493":"The decrypting process gets two values from the second block, exchanges and adds them, and the result serves as a final index to recover the element from the second block with which the xor will be achieved through the coded block.","494":"This description of the decryption algorythm has been identified as the **RC4 algorythm**.","495":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/17.png)","496":"After the decryption process, we find a PE binary, as seen in the following image.","497":"In this case, the payload does not start with the traditional MZ header but the string \u201ctokyo\u201d:","498":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/18.png)","499":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Screenshot-from-2022-01-10-16-37-59-1024x307.png)","500":"This creates another memory segment in the process netsh.exe with RWX licenses (that of 116Kb) which will be used to load the PE:","501":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/20-1024x89.png)","502":"In this new segment, it maps the binary using the virtual addresses as the regular Windows PE loader would do.","503":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/21-3-1024x363.png)","504":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/22-1024x441.png)","505":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/23.png)","506":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/24.png)","507":"After the correct mapping and having loaded the necessary libraries for its proper functioning, it calls EAX to run the decrypted and mapped payload:","508":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/25-1024x452.png)","509":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/26.png)","510":"To summarize, this article goes through the process followed in memory after executing the Creative Cloud application until deploying TokyoX in memory.","511":"This DLL sideloading style is often linked to APT groups whose attribution is also linked to China, however being a known technique as it is, we are not able to consider any feasible attribution at the moment.","512":"As reviewed at the beginning of the article, what we have named as \u201cTokyoX\u201d has not been identified as a known malware so far (at least, with the sources that we have).","513":"The string \u201cAheadLib\u201d found among the code of the malicious version.dll drew our attention, and we quickly found two chinese (casually or not) GitHub repositories with the source code of some tool called AheadLib.","514":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/27.png)","515":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/28.png)","516":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/29.png)","517":"Read the second part of the analysis of the final \u201cTokyoX\u201d RAT and its capacities [here](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/tokyox-dll-side-loading-an-unknown-artifact-part-2\/).","518":"Customers with Lab52\u2019s APT intelligence private feed service already have more tools and means of detection for this campaign.","519":"In case of having threat hunting service or being client of S2Grupo CERT, this intelligence has already been applied.","520":"If you need more information about Lab52\u2019s private APT intelligence feed service, you can contact us through the [following link](https:\/\/lab52.io\/contact)","521":"TokyoX: DLL side-loading an unknown artifact (Part 2)","522":"As we mentioned in [the previous post](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/tokyox-dll-side-loading-an-unknown-artifact\/), we have performed an analysis of the threat which, lacking further information, we have not been able to identify it as a known threat.","523":"Thus, for the moment, we will keep referring to it as TokyoX.","524":"After the whole loading process, the first thing the threat does is to check for the existence of a mutex in the system with the name \u201caftdoslm\u201d and if it finds it, it terminates its execution in order to avoid multiple instances of the threat running in parallel.","525":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/1.png)","526":"It then generates a 32-character string similar to a md5 hash from the computer\u2019s file system and Volume information, which is used as the victim ID and placed at the beginning of every packet it sends to the command and control server:","527":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2.png)","528":"It then obtains the user name, computer name, local IP and operating system version, with which it builds a string and generates a first packet for the C2:","529":"At the time of the analysis the command and control server was not available.","530":"However, from the analysis of the threat assembly, it has been possible to observe that the response of the C2 is very similar to those sent by the threat, since it most likely contains the first 44 bytes of the threat request or a very similar content: the victim ID (in red) , the first three dwords (in green).","531":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/3.png)","532":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/4-1024x332.png)","533":"This command is not among the options accepted by the threat, but it is the one that the threat itself uses when it sends the first packet to the command and control server, and we assume that it is the one used as a beacon when it does not intend to do anything, since a command that is not supported by the switch statement will simply cause a 5-minute sleep and a new request to C2 after this time.","534":"Second comes the \u201c6011\u201d command which is relatively interesting since it first calls a function that will delete all the infection files and terminate the execution of the threat.","535":"The fact that makes it interesting to us is that after this call, inside the switch that controls each command, it appears again as a command to perform no action (in this case it should be the 6010 probably) and make another request to C2, although this code will never be executed because the initial function will close the process.","536":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/5.png)","537":"The next command is \u201c7010\u201d which scans the disks installed in the computer using the \u201cGetLogicalDriveStringsW\u201d API and sends the results to the command and control server.","538":"The command \u201c7011\u201d imitates the \u201cDir\u201d command as it receives after the code a folder path, and allows it to list the content of a folder, showing hidden and system files too.","539":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/6.png)","540":"The next command \u201c7017\u201d expects, after the command code, a structure with three dwords followed by a path with a filename, and allows to upload a file from the attacking computer to the victim machine.","541":"In order to do so, it first creates an empty file and then generates a new thread that will make a second request to the command and control server.","542":"Within the response from the C2, this request expects the contents of the file to be uploaded, which the requesting thread will store in the file generated by the main thread.","543":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/7.png)","544":"In this case, it generates a new thread that tries to read that file within the victim computer and makes a second request to the C2 containing the raw content, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate files from the infected computer.","545":"Finally, there is the \u201c8001\u201d command with a command string to be run in a cmd.exe shell, since it calls CreateProcessW for \u201ccmd.exe\u201d with the input and output redirected by anonymous pipes to the executable itself.","546":"Then, it executes the command received in the request and replies to the C2 with the output of that command, thus forming a remote Shell of the victim machine.","547":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/8.png)","548":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/9.png)","549":"Although **we do not have enough evidence to make any kind of attribution**, there are some characteristic TTPs in the infection chain: the attacker using a Dll-sideload with a legitimate binary and a library, the fact that the library is responsible for decrypting and executing a third encrypted file in memory, and the fact of removing the MZ characters from the beginning of the binary and replacing them with another string.","550":"This last characteristic is very common in APT groups that use PlugX as the main threat, where instead of using \u201ctokyo\u201d to replace MZ, they usually add \u201cplug\u201d at

an attack campaign which targets government and military personnel of India.","557":"In fact, targeting the Indian government seems to be one of the key indicators of the group that may be behind this attack.","558":"Furthermore, some of the artifacts and infrastructure used to carry out the novel infection campaign are strongly related to the threat group Transparent Tribe.","559":"Initially, Lab52 detected a suspicious IMG file (Covid\\_Letter.img \u2013 948dffef9a11c11a6d81905e59ca1882) that was uploaded in VirusTotal via the web site from India, with upload date 09-06-2021.","560":"This file may have been sent attached to an email and contains a PDF document and some artifacts in order to display a decoy PDF to the user and initiate the infection process in the background.","561":"The PDF is named Vaccination06042021.pdf and its contents are related to COVID vaccination for employees over 45 years of age at the Central Administration of the Government of India.","562":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/1-2-810x1024.png)","563":"Although this decoy PDF document is harmless, the IMG file contains some other artifacts that will carry out the infection.","564":"Firstly, the IMG file contains a shortcut with the same name as the PDF document, which will be in charge of starting the infection by launching a Visual Basic script called doc.vbs.","565":"The infection chain continues executing both the decoy PDF document and a Windows PE (ServiceHub.MsDetouredHost.exe \u2013 68d73d596a7103e517967f7f4e22cecb) which after being analyzed, we have been able to identify it as a Python\/PeppyRAT.","566":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/2v2-2-1024x843.jpg)","567":"The main feature of this Windows executable is the ability to run embedded Python commands from itself.","568":"For this, the threat firstly relaunches itself and then starts building a new IAT (*Import Address Table*) referencing a large number of Python functions contained in the Python27.dll library that will be executed later.","569":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/3-2-1024x413.png)","570":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/4-1-1024x604.png)","571":"The crux of the matter is that by dropping all python compiled objects and dynamic-link libraries required into %TEMP% directory, it makes this python command execution technique possible through a Windows PE file.","572":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/5-2.png)","573":"An example of python command execution though a Windows PE can be seen below:","574":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/6-2.png)","575":"Once the threat gets its environment all set, it builds and loads into memory a Python script that will be in charge of obtaining the list of running processes and notifying the command-and-control server through an HTTP POST request.","576":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/7-2.png)","577":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/8-2.png)","578":"As a result, we have a python script composed by seven functions plus its main function.","579":"This script will notify to the C2C the extracted computer info and also set persistence into the victim machine.","580":"Most important python functions are the following:","581":"**Description:** Collect computer data: Get list of running processes","582":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/9-1.png)","583":"**Description:** Collect computer data: Get OS version and machine

server","588":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/12-2.png)","589":"As for network communications, as seen in the synchronize python function, the threat sends the list of running processes obtained, the OS version and the username through an HTTP request.","590":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/13-2-1024x211.png)","591":"This domain, where the C2C is hosted, resolves to an IP address that belongs to Digital Ocean VPS service.","592":"So, the threat actors make use of this infrastructure to take control of compromised computers and carry out actions from their C2C.","593":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/14-2.png)","594":"Finally, as a persistence mechanism, *simplify* function drops a new Windows PE file into the current user startup folder: (%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\devenv.defender.scr).","595":"This later artifact has been developed in .NET framework and its purpose is very simple: waiting to receive a new infection module from the C2C, which is a DLL file named mscontainer.dll:","596":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/15-2.png)","597":"So far, we analyzed a threat whose main capabilities are for initial access and recognition of the compromised computer as a common operational characteristic of the threat group, in order to detect if the malware was executed in a sandbox or others analysis environments.","598":"Therefore, we could consider it as the first stage and wait for new artifacts from the command-and-control server.","599":"The Windows DLL *mscontainer.dll* sent afterwards by the C2C seems to be the next stage of infection.","600":"Remember that this artifact is expected by the last analyzed PE devenv.defender.scr which persists on the Windows startup folders.","601":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/16-2.png)","602":"![](https:\/\/lab52.io\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/17-3-1024x336.png)","603":"The threat-analysis has allowed us to obtain 37 decrypted strings, the commands accepted by the C2C and its hosted domain and others related to their capabilities, etc.","604":"For the time being, no new infection scenarios and\/or modules implemented by the C2C server have been obtained.","605":"On the whole, this infection campaign seems to be related to the threat group Transparent Tribe, trying to compromise Indian government once again.","606":"This assumption is based on the fact that the PDF content targeted to the government of India and the TTPs employed during the infection process are common on this group.","607":"Even though this threat group usually deploys CrimsonRAT as an initial access threat, this time they have deployed PeppyRAT.","608":"So, it could be considered a variation of the TTPs related to the APT group Transparent Tribe.","609":"MITRE TTPs:","610":"| T1547.001 | Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys \/ Startup Folder |","611":"| T1566.001

communicates DNS information over a secure HTTPS connection in an encrypted manner.","893":"However, DoH does not provide end-to-end security and only protects communications while in transit.","894":"The primary benefit of DoH is that it encrypts all DNS information, whereas DNS is currently sent in plain text over HTTP.","895":"Therefore, DoH offers more privacy and data protection, especially from Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks (e.g. DNS hijacking and spoofing) that would allow for snooping and manipulation of the DNS information.","896":"Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox were early adopters, having rolled out DoH in their respective browsers in late 2019.","897":"Malware authors have rushed to exploit DoH in their attack operations because a victim\u2019s DNS traffic will now often bypass organizational DNS infrastructure, circumventing security detection and protection systems.","898":"At the time of initial rollout in 2019, we assessed it would be very likely that more malware families would begin to incorporate DoH into their operations, as well as new data-exfiltration tools leveraging DoH as C2.","899":"In fact, in July 2020 Researchers from Kaspersky reported on [Iran-linked threat actor group *APT34*](https:\/\/quointelligence.eu\/2020\/12\/cyber-security-trends-in-2021\/) (also known as *OilRig*) evolving tactics using DNS-over-HTTPS

Europe","1125":"In August 2021, Zscaler ThreatLabz identified several malicious Microsoft Word documents which used a multi-stage attack-chain abusing Cloudflare Workers and features of MS Office Word to target users in Central Asia and Eastern Europe.","1126":"Based on the social engineering lures used in the decoy content, we conclude with a moderate confidence level that the targets of this campaign were scientists and researchers who were invited to International military conferences.","1127":"We have named this threat actor CloudFall based on the network infrastructure used by them.","1128":"There is also a strong overlap between this threat actor and the CloudAtlas APT group.","1129":"Unlike common macro-based document attacks, in this targeted campaign we observed the threat actor abusing MS Office Word features to evade automated analysis systems.","1130":"There were multiple variants of attack-chains used by this threat actor which highlight the adversary's deep understanding of the MS Office Word application.","1131":"2.Naming convention of attacker-controlled C2 domains","1132":"**Attack-chain**: In all the cases, an MS Office Word document was used to download a remote document template and carry out the attack in multiple stages.","1133":"A lot of TTPs in this attack-chain have not been seen before and are unique to the threat actor in this case.","1134":"**Naming conventions of attacker-controlled C2 domains**: We observed a consistent pattern across all the C2 domains used in this targeted campaign.","1135":"All the C2 servers used Cloudflare Worker domains and most of the subdomain names were crafted to spoof Microsoft service names such as Office 365.","1136":"**Regions targeted and content of the decoy files**: Based on the instances we observed in this campaign, the regions targeted were Central Asia and Eastern Europe.","1137":"Based on this, we can say with a moderate confidence level that the threat actor was located in the eastern part of the world.","1138":"By combining all of the above observations, we can say with a moderate confidence level that there is an overlap with CloudAtlas APT threat actor.","1139":"CloudAtlas APT has targeted users in Central Asia and Eastern Europe in the past with documents sent in spear-phishing emails and downloaded remote templates.","1140":"CloudAtlas has also abused legitimate cloud-based services, such as CloudMe, in the past and used domain names that spoof legitimate Microsoft services.","1141":"The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are very unique in this instance so we cannot use them to specifically attribute to any threat actor.","1142":"For the document with MD5 hash: 4cf8b660a79fc1b7cc4ea6422a02347d, seen in Figure 1, the cover image is the logo of the German Federal Foreign Office.","1143":"![Figure 1](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/CloudFall\/Picture%201.png)","1144":"![Figure 2](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/CloudFall\/Picture%202.png)","1145":"In this campaign, the threat actor used a complex multi-stage attack-chain, which we illustrate in Figure 3.","1146":"Also, it is important to note that there are 2 different variants of attack-chains that we observed for this threat actor.","1147":"![Figure 3](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/CloudFall\/Picture%203.jpg)","1148":"The interesting thing to note here is that the attacker doesn\u2019t use the standard DOCX file format (OOXML) for template injection where we have the XML file referencing the document template from a network path.","1149":"#### **Stage-2: Macro-based template document**","1150":"Once macros are enabled by the user, the VBA macro code inside the downloaded template is executed.","1151":"The macro code performs the following operations:","1152":"Below is the relevant VBA macro code responsible for this.","1153":"**2.** When the document is closed, it checks whether a document template file is present in the path: \"%appdata%\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP\\Main.dotm\".","1154":"It's important to note that the above directory path corresponds to STARTUP location used by Microsoft Office Word application to load global templates.","1155":"The template file is downloaded as base64-encoded data from the URL: \"https:\/\/cloud.digitalstorage.workers[.]dev\/old\/data\".","1156":"Macro replaces \u00a0\"$\" with \"A\" and \"#\" with \"Q\" in the mangled response before base64-decoding.","1157":"The template file \"Main.dotm\" acts as a persistence template since it is loaded whenever the Microsoft Word application is started.","1158":"Similar to Stage-2, this is also a macro-based template.","1159":"The malicious macro code is defined under the AutoExit function which is executed when the Microsoft Word application is closed or the global template defining it is unloaded.","1160":"Upon execution, the macro code downloads a base64-encoded binary either from \"mirror.advancestore.workers[.]dev\/max\/bs\" or \"mirror.advancestore.workers[.]dev\/min\/bs\" based on the checks performed.","1161":"Similar to Stage-2, the base64-encoded binary is mangled and requires character substitution before decoding.","1162":"Once decoded, the macro code drops it as the next stage payload in the path %localappdata%\\Photos\\Microsoft.Photos.exe and executes it.","1163":"**Note**: The dropped file name spoofs legitimate Windows binary for Microsoft Photos.","1164":"![Figure 4](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/CloudFall\/Picture%204.png)","1165":"*Figure 4: VBA macro code of Stage-3 persistence document template*","1166":"The Stage-4 dropped binary is heavily obfuscated using control flow obfuscation, function inlining, stack-based strings generation, strings encoding, etc which makes the dynamic analysis of the binary inside a debugger difficult.","1167":"To further hinder the dynamic analysis using debugger, the binary performs self checksum check to detect any attached debugger.","1168":"![Figure 5](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/CloudFall\/Picture%205.jpg)","1169":"Executing further, the malicious binary checks for the presence of the file conf.h in the current working directory.","1170":"![Conf Check](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/CloudFall\/Conf%20Check.jpg)","1171":"*Figure 6:\u00a0Code section which performs conf.h string generation and file existence check*","1172":"**Note:** \u00a0The file is likely fetched and dropped by the binary as part of C2 communication","1173":"If the conf.h file doesn\u2019t exist, then it checks the following browser directories for the presence of specific files one at a time:","1174":"In case the calculated size is less than the threshold value or if none of the browser directory mentioned above exists, the binary terminates.","1175":"**Note:** The size check is likely performed to detect analysis environments like Sandbox and Virtual Machine","1176":"![Threshold Check](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/CloudFall\/Threshold%20Check.jpg)","1177":"*Figure 7: Code section which performs the\u00a0threshold check*","1178":"If the check passes for any of the three browser directories mentioned above then it starts the network communication.","1179":"The network communication is performed over standard TCP\/IP protocol.","1180":"The details for the C2 server communication are mentioned below:","1181":"**C2 Domain:** curly-waterfall-360d.fetrikekke531.workers.dev","1182":"**Beacon request URI:** auth\/local\/register","1183":"**Note:** During analysis we didn\u2019t get any active response from the C2 server.","1184":"**[+] SSL Certificate**","1185":"The thumbprint of the SSL certificate of the C2 domain is: 5cdf93a4081898d99a686ad472b553cddaa9f3bf","1186":"**Below are some important details of this SSL certificate:**","1187":"Using the thumbprint of the SSL certificate as a pivot, we discovered another C2 domain: virustotall-360d.fetrikekke531.workers[.]dev","1188":"As we can see, the subdomain in above domain spoofs VirusTotal.","1189":"The second variant of this attack, which we observed in August 2021 made significant changes to the macro code used in the document to deploy the payload on the machine.","1190":"Similar to variant 1, variant 2 also downloads a remote document template hosted on an attacker-controlled Cloudflare Worker instance.","1191":"However, unlike variant 1, in this case, the persistence document template as well as the final payload\u2014both are embedded inside the stage-2 document itself.","1192":"![Figure 7](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/CloudFall\/Picture%207.jpg)","1193":"**1.** Stage-1 document downloads remote document template (Stage-2)","1194":"**2.** Since MS Office Word was used to download the document template (Stage-2), by default it will be present inside the INetCache directory.","1195":"The VBA macro code uses a clever technique to locate this file in the path: \"%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Content.MSO\\\" as shown in Figure 9.","1196":"![Figure 8](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/CloudFall\/Picture%208.png)","1197":"*Figure 9: VBA macro code of Stage-2 document template of variant 2*","1198":"**a)** This code enumerates the files in the directory: \"%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\Content.MSO\\\" until it finds a file with size 70400 (truncated)","1199":"**b)** Once it finds the file, it will Unzip the contents to the directory path: \"%localappdata%\\VirtualEnv\".","1200":"OOXML file format is essentially an archive file format, and that\u2019s why the macro unzips it.","1201":"**c)** Inside the OOXML file, there is an XML file called Archive.xml which contains an encoded version of the persistence template.","1202":"This is decoded and dropped to the path: %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP\\Settings.dotm","1203":"**d)** In order to decode the contents of Archive.xml it performs character substitution to restore the original characters of the base64-encoded string.","1204":"This type of custom base64 decoding is similar to variant 1","1205":"**3.** Once a new instance of the Word application is started on the machine, this persistence template is loaded and the next sequence of steps are carried out to drop the final payload as shown in Figure 10.","1206":"![Figure 9](\/cdn-cgi\/image\/format=auto\/sites\/default\/files\/images\/blogs\/CloudFall\/Picture%209.png)","1207":"*Figure 10: VBA macro code of persistence template of variant 2*","1208":"**a)** Decodes and extracts the payload from WebArchive.xml file.","1209":"The method for decoding is similar to the one described previously.","1210":"**b)** The decoded file is the final payload which will be dropped to the path: %localappdata%\\VirtualEnv\\word\\Virtual.exe","1211":"**4.** Finally the payload Virtual.exe will be executed.","1212":"This payload is similar to the one described above.","1213":"### **Zscaler Cloud Sandbox detection**","1214":"Figure 11 shows the sandbox detection for the final payload.","1215":"![Figure

using a technique known as email thread hijacking.","1247":"Email thread hijacking leverages emails that have been stolen prior to the attack and later repurposed to dupe a victim into believing that an email is from someone that they know who is replying to the same thread.","1248":"Once a victim clicks on the URL, a ZIP file is downloaded that contains a Microsoft Word document.","1249":"This document is using a DocuSign template lure that instructs the user to enable a macro to view the content (as shown in Figure 2).","1250":"All the other documents analyzed by Zscaler ThreatLabz have

malware","1565":"* Emotet is one of the most dangerous, prolific, and long-lasting malware Trojans that has ever existed.","1566":"* In January 2021, a law enforcement action disrupted the Emotet malware and its infrastructure.","1567":"It also led to the arrest of some of the threat actors involved with the malware.","1568":"* After almost a year-long hiatus, Emotet has returned to the threat landscape as of Nov 14, 2021.","1569":"* Distribution of the malware was via the TrickBot malware and email campaigns.","1570":"After an almost year-long hiatus, the prolific malware [Emotet](https:\/\/www.zscaler.com\/blogs\/security-research\/emotet-back-action-after-short-break) has returned to the threat landscape.","1571":"An [early report](https:\/\/cyber.wtf\/2021\/11\/15\/guess-whos-back\/) indicated it returned on Sunday November 14, 2021 and it was being distributed via the [TrickBot](https:\/\/www.zscaler.com\/blogs\/security-research\/new-trickbot-and-bazarloader-campaigns-use-multiple-delivery-vectors) botnet.","1572":"A [later report](https:\/\/isc.sans.edu\/diary\/28044) indicated that it was also being distributed via email campaigns.","1573":"The Emotet malware was first detected back in 2014 and it focused on banking fraud.","1574":"In recent years, Emotet pivoted and it became an initial access broker providing victim access for several ransomware groups.","1575":"In January 2021, [law enforcement](https:\/\/www.europol.europa.eu\/newsroom\/news\/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action) disrupted the Emotet malware and its infrastructure.","1576":"It also arrested some of the threat actors behind it.","1577":"This led to the disappearance of the malware for almost a year.","1578":"While the Threatlabz team's technical analysis for the payloads involved is ongoing, the new version of the Emotet malware is similar to its past variants in many aspects.","1579":"In our quick analysis, we've observed some changes in the command and control data and encryption used.","1580":"It also appears to be using HTTPS instead of\u00a0 plain HTTP for command and control communication.","1581":"It looks like most of the functionality is the same as earlier variants, and it will likely pick up where it left off, providing initial access to the ransomware operators.","1582":"As we can see from the below screenshot of spam email, Emotet starts by leveraging a 'reply chain' email strategy in their spam campaigns.","1583":"It has been using MS word document \u201c.docm\u201d, MS excel \u201c.xlsm\u201d and password
