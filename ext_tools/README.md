# SoK: External Tools

This folder contains code related to some state-of-the-art CTI approaches[1,2,3].
Each folder in `tools` has the name of the respective tool.
To test the tools, you need to generate the local environment with local `requirements.txt`, one for each folder, then, execute  
```bash
$ cd tools/TOOL_NAME
$ python test_TOOL_NAME_bosch.py
```
